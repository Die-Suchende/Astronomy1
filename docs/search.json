The brightenss we observe is therefore not an intrinsic property of the stars, as it depends on the distance between the observer and the stars.\nThis is the reason why we need to differentiate between the apparent brightness of a star and its luminosity.\nLet’s look at how the spectrum changes with temperature \\(T\\).\nWe can try out this PhET interactive simulator and by varying the temperature we can see how the black body spectrum changes.\nThe change of the spectral radiance with temperature is shown in Figure 9.1.\nCode\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfor T in [6000,5500,5000,4500,4000]:\n    B_planck = 2*h.value*c.value**2 * (1.0/(np.exp(h.value*c.value/(k_B.value*T*(l*1e-9)))-1)) / (l*1e-9)**5\n    plt.plot(l, B_planck, label='T='+str(T)+'K')\n\n\nplt.xlabel(r'Wavelength $\\lambda$ (nm)')\nplt.ylabel(r'Spectral Radiance $B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T=4000K)$ (Wm$^{-3}$sr$^{-1}$)')\nplt.title('Spectral radiance at different temperatures')\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Spectral radiance at different temperatures.\nFrom Figure 9.1 we notice that the Planck spectrum:\nBlack bodies radiate at all wavelengths - they won’t look black! The shape of the spectrum and the position of the peak determine the apparent colour of the object.\nThe total (bolometric) luminosity per area (“radiant emittance” \\(j=\\frac{L}{A}\\)) has units of \\(\\mathrm{W\\,m}^{-2}\\), and is the spectral radiance integrated over solid angle and wavelength:\nThe equation for this is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. \\[\nj = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^4 T^4}{60 \\hbar^3 c^2}.\n\\tag{10.1}\\]\nThis can be written more simply as\n\\[\nj = \\sigma T^4\n\\tag{10.2}\\]\nwhere \\[\n\\sigma = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^4 }{60 \\hbar^3 c^2} = 5.67\\times 10^{-8}\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}K^{-4}}\n\\tag{10.3}\\] is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nWe can multiply Equation 10.3 by the surface area to find the total luminosity of a spherical star of radius \\(R\\).\nIt allows us to relate \\(R\\), \\(L\\), and \\(T\\) for a star.\nYou need to be able to solve these types of problem - practice it!"

    "text": "4.4 Measuring the distance to the stars\n\n4.4.1 The parallax method\nWe started with the easy example of answering how distant is the Sun, but what about other stars? One way to determine the distance to nearest stars is to use the parallax method.\nIf you look at the position of a closer object against a further background, you will notice that the image of the near object will shift in the background as you move (see Figure 4.3). This effect is called parallax and you can experience it even when you close one eye at the time looking at an object against a background.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Illustrative example of the parallax method. The background against which the yellow star object is seen changes based on the viewpoint.\n\n\nAnalogously, in a background of distant stars, a closer star will appear to move against them as the Earth orbits the Sun. So how do we use this to determine the distance to a start? We use trigonometry.\nThe angle formed between the lines of sight of a star from two positions of the observer is twice the parallax angle. Figure 4.4 shows the parallax as the angle between the lines of sight of the observer on Earth and from the Sun (the middle point between the position of Earth six months apart).\nThe number of stars that can be observed from Earth is limited and nowadays direct observations of the distance using the parallax method are done by satellites orbiting the Sun in sync with Earth. Hipparcos gathered data on more than one million stars, and its successor Gaia has already observed 2 billion stars!\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Parallax and parsecs representation. Image readapted from: https://www.astronomy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/parsec.png\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parallax is generally measured in arcseconds (as).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArcseconds - degrees - radians conversion\n\n\n\n\\[\n  \\mathrm{1 arcsecond} = \\dfrac{1}{3600} \\deg = \\dfrac{1}{206,265} \\mathrm{radians}.\n\\]\nYou can show these conversions by recalling that \\[\n  1\\ \\mathrm{rad} = 57.3\\deg = (57.3\\times 60\\times 60)\\ \\mathrm{as}=206,265\\ \\mathrm{as}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParsec definition\n\n\n\n\nThe parsec (parallax-second, pc) is defined as:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n1\\ \\mathrm{parsec} &= \\dfrac{1 \\mathrm{au}}{\\mathrm{arcsecond\\  in\\  radians}} = 206,265\\mathrm{au}= \\dfrac{648000}{\\pi} \\mathrm{au}\\\\\n&\\approx 3.086\\times 10^{16}\\mathrm{m}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nA parallax of 1 arcsecond corresponds to a distance to the star of 1 parsec (3.26 light-years).\nUsing trigonometry, the distance \\(d\\) to the star, in astronomical units, is given by:\n\n\\[\n    d =\\dfrac{1 \\mathrm{au}}{\\tan p}\\simeq \\dfrac{1}{p} \\mathrm{au}\n\\] where \\(p\\) is the parallax, and for this approximation we used \\(p\\) measured in radians. Converting the parallax \\(p\\) to \\(p''\\), from radians to arcseconds, we obtain the distance in parsec: \\[\n    d \\simeq\\dfrac{206,265 \\mathrm{au}}{p''}= \\dfrac{1}{p''} \\mathrm{pc}\n\\]\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nAU = 149597870 # km\npc = 648000/np.pi*AU # km\nprint(f\"1parsec = {pc:1.3e} km\")\n\n\n1parsec = 3.086e+13 km\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 The nearest star: Proxima Centauri\nThe further a star is, the smaller the parallax angle.\nThe nearest star (Proxima Centauri) has a parallax of 0.7681 arcseconds. This is very tiny, but still, we are able to measure it! To give you an idea of how small this is:\n\nIt is approximately the angle subtended by an object having a diameter of 2 centimeters, positioned at a distance of 5.3km!\nThe shift produced by the parallax against the background would be \\(1/2000^{th}\\) the width of the Full Moon!\n\nThe parallax method is covered in other courses, so this is just a taster, but now knowing the parallax of Proxima Centauri (or another star), we can find the distance to that.\n\n\nCode\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\ndef arcsec_to_rad(p):\n    rad = p/206265\n    return rad\n\np = 0.7681 # as\nd_pc = 1/p # pc\n\np_rad = arcsec_to_rad(p)\nd_au = 1/p_rad # au\nd_km = d_au*AU # km\nprint(f\"p = {p} as\")\nprint(f\"d = 1/p pc = 1/{p} pc = {d_pc:1.1e} pc\")\nprint(f\"d = 1/p pc = 206265/p au = 206265/{p} au = {d_au:1.1e} au\")\nprint(f\"d = {d_au:1.1e} au * 149597870 km = {d_km:1.1e} km\")\nprint(f\"The distance from Proxima Centauri is = {d_pc:1.1e} pc = {d_au:1.1e} au = {d_km:1.1e} km\")\n\n\np = 0.7681 as\nd = 1/p pc = 1/0.7681 pc = 1.3e+00 pc\nd = 1/p pc = 206265/p au = 206265/0.7681 au = 2.7e+05 au\nd = 2.7e+05 au * 149597870 km = 4.0e+13 km\nThe distance from Proxima Centauri is = 1.3e+00 pc = 2.7e+05 au = 4.0e+13 km\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 ‘Spot the mistake’ question:\nAn unknown star has a parallax of 379.21 mas. Your messy lecturer tried to calculate the distance to the star but she must have made some mistakes because something looks wrong. Can you tell what?\n# This is the version with mistakes\nimport math\n\np = 379.21/10000 # as \nd_pc = 206265/p # pc\n\nd_au = 1/p # au\n\nAU = 149597870 # km\nd_km = d_au*AU # km\nprint(f\"The distance to the star is = {d_pc:1.1e} pc = {d_au:1.1e} au = {d_km:1.1e} km?

Something was clearly wrong with the orders of magnitudes of the values obtained in the wrong solution:\n\nthe distance in pc can not be larger than the distance in au! Those orders of magnitude are clearly off!\nif you compare this with the values obtained for Proxima Centauri, you should expect approximately the same orders of magnitude\n\\(10^6\\) pc would be way too far to be able to use the parallax method to measure the distance: the most precise and reliable measurements of the parallax (with the Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia space mission), can measure distances of the order of \\(10^3\\mathrm{pc}\\).\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# The correct version\nimport math\n\np = 379.21/1000 # as &lt;- the units conversion was wrong\nd_pc = 1/p # pc &lt;- This formula for the distance in pc was swapped with the one below for the distance in au\n\nd_au = 206265/p # au\n\nAU = 149597870 # km\nd_km = d_au*AU # km\nprint(f\"The distance to the star is = {d_pc:1.1e} pc = {d_au:1.1e} au = {d_km:1.1e} km\")\n\n\nThe distance to the star is = 2.6e+00 pc = 5.4e+05 au = 8.1e+13 km"

    "text": "4.5 Transit method\n The parallax was also originally proposed as a way to determine the distance to the Sun by the Scottish astronomer James Gregory, in 1663, using the transit of Venus. Gregory is seldom given any credits for this idea and usually all the credits goes to Edmund Halley for some reason (can anyone find out why?).\nIn 1677, at the age of 20, Halley travelled to St Helena to map the Southern Skies and observed a transit of Mercury on November 7th. Like Gregory, he suggested that the transit of a planet like Venus could be used as a method to measure the distance to the Sun, using parallax.\nHere is the translation of Halley’s publication about this idea.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: A composite image of the June 2004 transit of Venus as seen from Waldenburg, Germany. Credit: E. SLAWIK/SPL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Representation of the transit method\n\n\nAccording to ‘Halley’s method’, two observers (A and B in the figure above) have to be positioned at a great distance from each other, but both located on the side of Earth facing the Sun at the time of the transit. Each observer would precisely measure the times that Venus appear to be in different positions (contact points) relative to the Sun. The observers would see different chords of the planet’s trajectory across the disk of the sun due to parallax. Venus forms two similar triangles with the Earth and the Sun at their opposite edges. Since the triangles are similar, the projected distance on the Sun can be found by comparing it to a known baseline on Earth. Once the angle shift is measured, the distances to Venus and then to the Sun can be determined using trigonometry.\nModern techniques use radar echo ranging to measure distances in the Solar System very precisely."

    "text": "6.1 Apparent brightness and luminosity\nThe apparent brightness, \\(F\\), also referred to as the radiant flux or power flux, is the total amount of energy emitted by a star, per unit time, crossing an unit area (units [\\(\\mathrm{W/m}^2\\)]). It is not an intrinsic property of a star, because it depends on the distance from the star.\nFigure 6.1 can give you a better understanding of that. Each square represents an unit area. The lightbulb, like a star, radiates equally in every direction (i.e. isotropically). The ‘rays’ coming out of the light source represent the flux. The farther the position of the observer is from the source, the less flux the observer, in one unit area, will receive. The relationship between the power flux, \\(F\\), and the distance to the source, \\(r\\), is given by the inverse square law: \\[F\\propto \\dfrac{1}{r^2}.\\] Since the light source radiates isotropically (even though the figure below shows only a portion of the rays), the power flux \\(F\\) is equal across all parts of the sphere at a given distance.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Inverse square law of the radiant flux of a light source\n\n\nThe Luminosity of a star, \\(L\\), measured in Watts (W) or equivalently Joules per second (J/s), is its energy output per unit time. The luminosity is the total energy radiated in all the directions in an unit time and it does not depend on the distance from the observer: it is an intrinsic property of the star.\nHow are these two quantities related?\nImagine a sphere of radius \\(r\\) centered on a star, which is isotropically radiating. We saw that the luminosity (energy output per unit time) does not depend upon the distance, but the radiant flux \\(F\\) does. To find the power flux \\(F\\), we need to divide the luminosity equally over the area of the sphere, \\(4\\pi r^2\\). Therefore \\[\nF = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nThe apparent brightness depends on the luminosity and on the distance of the observer from the star. From Equation 6.1, you can see how two stars of equal luminosity, located at different distances from Earth, would have different apparent brightness.\nPhotometry is the measurement of the quantity of light from a star, i.e. the flux of energy per unit time, per unit area, that we receive at Earth.\nFor a particular star, if we know the luminosity (\\(L\\)) of the star and its distance from Earth (\\(r\\)), we can calculate the radiant flux using Equation 6.1.\n\n6.1.1 The Sun’s luminosity\nFor our Sun, we have:\n\\(F_\\odot = 1361\\, \\mathrm{W/m^2}\\) (The “Solar Constant”, or “Solar irradiance”, sometimes indicated with the symbol \\(S_\\odot\\) in textbooks), and\n\\(r = 1\\, \\mathrm{a.u.} \\approx 1.5\\times 10^{11}\\mathrm{m}\\).\nTherefore, using Equation 6.1:\n\\(L_\\odot = 4\\pi r^2 F = 3.8275 \\times 10^{26}\\, \\mathrm{W}\\)\n\n\nCode\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy.constants import pi, au, parsec\n\nF = 1361.0 # W/m/m\nr = au # m\nL = F*4*pi*r**2\n\nprint(f'Power flux: F = {F} W/m/m')\nprint(f'r = 1au = {r:1.4e} m')\nprint(f'Luminosity: L =  F*4*pi*r**2 = {L:1.4e} W')\n\n\nPower flux: F = 1361.0 W/m/m\nr = 1au = 1.4960e+11 m\nLuminosity: L =  F*4*pi*r**2 = 3.8275e+26 W\n\n\nFor other stars there is a large range of luminosities:\n\\(10^{-4}\\,L_\\odot &lt; L &lt; 10^{6}\\,L_\\odot\\)\nIf we think of the least luminous star as a 100W incandescent lightbulb, this huge range tells us that the most luminous star would be like the entire world’s power output.\nWhy is there this very large range? We will answer this question in the next lectures.\n\n\n6.1.2 ‘Spot the mistake’ question:\nWhat would the apparent brightness be for a star like the Sun at a distance of 10 pc?\nSomething does not seem to make sense in the answer below, why?\n# This is the version containing a mistake\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\nL = 3.8275E26 # W\nr = 10 #pc\nF = L/(4*np.pi*r**2) # W/m^2\nprint(f'Solar luminosity: L = {L} W')\nprint(f'Distance: r = {r} pc')\nprint(f'Apparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: F = L/(4*pi*r^2) = {F:1.4e} W/m/m')\nSolar luminosity: L = 3.8275e+26 W\nDistance: r = 10 pc\nApparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: \\(F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2} = 3.0458\\times 10^{23} W/m^2\\)\n\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\nCompare this apparent brightness obtained below with the value of the power flux used (the Solar constant) in the previous example. What is wrong?\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\nDo a ‘sanity check’ of the units in the quantities used above. Does it seem correct?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nIf we compare this value obtained for the apparent brightness, \\(F=3.046\\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{W/m}^2\\), with the Solar constant used in the previous example, \\(F_\\odot = 1361 \\mathrm{W/m}^2\\), we can immediately notice that something is wrong by just looking at the extreme difference in the orders of magnitude. If we are observing the Sun from a further position of 10pc instead of 1au, we cannot expect it to appear brighter!\n‘Sanity check’: Let’s check the units of the quantities given above, replacing them in Equation 6.1: \\[ F=\\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2} \\implies [W/m^2] = \\frac{[W]}{[pc]^2} \\]. This does not return an identity since \\([m]\\neq [pc]\\), so now we know where made a mistake, by just checking the units!\nTo calculate the value of the flux correctly, you need to convert the distance from parsecs to meters, because the flux should be written in units of [\\(W/m^2\\)]!\nThe correct answer is:\n# Correct version\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy.constants import pi, parsec\nL = 3.8275E26 # W\nr = 10*parsec #m\nF = L/(4*pi*r**2)\nprint(f'Solar luminosity: L = {L} W')\nprint(f'Distance: r = {r} pc')\nprint(f'Apparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: F = L/(4*pi*r^2) = {F:1.4e} W/m/m')\nSolar luminosity: L = 3.8275e+26 W\nDistance: r = 10 pc = 3.0857e+17 m\nApparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: \\(F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2} = 3.1989\\times 10^{-10} W/m^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanity checks\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways be careful about the units used or units conversions!\nGet the habit of doing ‘sanity checks’: check the dimensional analysis and units when you use or derive formulas. This will help you spot some mistakes quickly and it is incredibly useful to rederive some formulas sometime.\n\n\n\nIn Equation 6.1 for instance, we know that the apparent brightness \\(F\\) has units of [W/m \\(^2\\)] and that the luminosity \\(L\\) has units of [W]. Writing the units of each side of the equation, we see that: \\([W/m^2]=\\dfrac{[W]}{[m^2]}\\), which as expected satisfies the identity, meaning that the formula is dimensionally correct."

    "text": "6.2 Stellar magnitude scales\nThe flux from even nearby stars is tiny, but many bright stars are distinguished by the naked eye. The human eye (like hearing) responds logarithmically to stimulus. When comparing the flux densities of three stars in a 1:10:100 ratio, the perceived brightness gap between the first and second star appears to be the same as the difference between the second and third star. This equality in perceived brightness gaps illustrates that human perception of brightness operates on a logarithmic scale. Therefore, before modern photometry, astronomers had a scale based on their own naked-eye observations: stellar (apparent) magnitude.\n\n6.2.1 Apparent magnitude\nThis system to measure the stars brightness was first introduced by the Greek astronomer Hipparchos, who compiled a catalog of 850 stars with their positions and their apparent magnitudes on a scale from \\(m=1\\), being the brightest stars, to \\(m=6\\), being the faintest stars. The apparent magnitude depends on the position of the observer the same way as the flux does (in fact, we will see in the following how these two quantities are related).\nThe image below shows an example of a star catalog created by ancient Greek astronomers.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Almagest Ptolemy, c. 150AD image credit: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris\n\n\nThe English translation reads\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Almagest translated\n\n\nWe can still recognise the constellations and find these stars today!\n\n\n\nUrsa Minor constellation and magnitude scale.

Partly this is because the scientific definition and measurements are more precise, but also Polaris is a variable star (its brightness changes).\nThe apparent magnitude scale introduced by Hipparchos has been replaced by Pogson in 1856 and is no longer limited to values between 1 and 6, it now extends between m=-26.83 for the Sun to over m=30 for the faintest object, but the new classification kept these characteristics:\n\n5 magnitude steps correspond to a factor of 100 in apparent brightness\nA difference of 1 magnitude corresponds to an apparent brightness ratio of \\(100^{1/5}\\simeq 2.512\\), i.e. \\[\\dfrac{F_{m+1}}{F_m}=100^{1/5} \\tag{6.2}\\]\nLower magnitudes are brighter\nThe zero point of the apparent magnitude has been conventionally determined.\n\n\nThe apparent magnitude \\(m\\) is a measure of a star’s apparent brightness, i.e. the flux received from the star, and it therefore depends on how close the star is to the observer.\nThe definition of the apparent magnitude is based on the difference between magnitudes and corresponds to the ratio between two stars’ radiant fluxes, as stated in the properties above.\nIf we consider two stars with measured radiant fluxes (units \\(W/m^2\\)) \\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\), their apparent magnitudes will be related by \\[\nm_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\frac{F_1}{F_2}\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\n\n6.2.1.1 Apparent magnitude zero point convention\nThe values of the apparent magnitudes are determined in relation to a zero point value \\(m=0\\).

However, to remind us that a value (e.g. \\(m=-26\\)) is a magnitude, you can use the notation ‘mag’ after the numerical value (e.g. \\(m=-26\\) mag).\n\nBeware confusing mass and magnitude when using the same symbol \\(m\\)!\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Question\nThe coefficient in the formula for the apparent magnitude is 2.5.

Consequently, you may have different values of the apparent and absolute magnitudes of the Sun (or other stars). For example, you may find that in some books the solar absolute bolometric magnitude is \\(M_\\odot=4.83\\) instead of \\(M_\\odot=4.74\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Setting the Absolute Magnitude scale\nWe will need to convert magnitudes to S.I. units of luminosity. \nBased on the  IAU 2015 resolution, we use the zero point luminosity previously introduced in Equation 6.9 (\\(L_0=3.0128\\times 10^{28}\\) W) to define the absolute magnitude in Equation 6.10. Rearranging this, we find that for a star with absolute magnitude \\(M\\), the luminosity is given by \\[\nL = L_0 10^{-0.4 M}.\n\\tag{6.12}\\]\nYou may notice that this definition uses only the zero point value of the luminosity defined in Equation 6.9 to relate the luminosity and absolute magnitude of a star.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nOnce again, some caution is needed when consulting textbooks and other sources, as conventions may change. Other (outdated) sources may use other references for the absolute magnitude \\(M_2\\) of Equation 6.8 instead of the zero value used in Equation 6.10 and in the derivation above. In some cases for instance you may find that the solar absolute magnitude is used: \\(M_2=M_{\\odot}=4.74\\) (remember that even this value can change depending on the convention used, see ‘caution’ callout above.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.6 Example\nWe can use this formula to recover the luminosity of the Sun previously used (\\(L_\\odot = 3.826 \\times 10^{26}\\mathrm{W}\\)), having the absolute magnitude of the Sun, \\(M_\\odot = 4.74\\).\n\n\nCode\nfrom astropy.constants import L_bol0\n\nM_sun = 4.74\nprint(L_bol0)\nL = L_bol0*10**(-0.4*M_sun)\nprint(f'Luminosity of the Sun: L = {L:1.3e}')\n\n\n  Name   = Luminosity for absolute bolometric magnitude 0\n  Value  = 3.0128e+28\n  Uncertainty  = 0.0\n  Unit  = W\n  Reference = IAU 2015 Resolution B 2\nLuminosity of the Sun: L = 3.828e+26 W\n\n\n\n\n6.2.7 Question\nShow that if we have two stars with luminosities (units \\(W\\)) \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\) at the same distance \\(r=10\\mathrm{pc}\\), their difference in the apparent magnitudes is the same as the difference of the absolute magnitudes:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nM_1 - M_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\frac{L_1}{L_2}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the relationship between flux and luminosity and the properties of logarithms.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nFor two stars at the same distance \\(r\\) (e.g. two stars in a binary), we can write \\[\\begin{align}\nm_1 - m_2 &= -2.5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_1}{4\\pi r^2} \\times \\frac{4\\pi r^2}{L_2} \\right)\\\\\n&= -2.5\\log_{10}\\frac{L_1}{L_2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nHaving defined the absolute magnitude using the zero point flux above, for the i-th star (i.e. for i=1,2) with luminosities \\(L_i\\) at distances of 10pc, the absolute magnitude is: \\(M_i = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\dfrac{L_i}{L_0}}\\)\nTherefore: \\[\\begin{align*}\nM_1 - M_2 & = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{L_1}{L_0}} - \\left(-2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{L_2}{L_0}}\\right) \\\\\n& = -2.5\\log_{10} L_1 +2.5\\log_{10} L_0 + 2.5\\log_{10} L_2 - 2.5\\log_{10} L_0 \\\\\n& = -2.5 \\log_{10} L_1 + 2.5 \\log_{10} L_2\\\\\n& = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{L_1}{L_2}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nFor two stars at the same distance of 10pc from the observer, the difference in the apparent magnitude is equal to the difference in the absolute magnitude.\n\n\n\n6.2.8 Relationship between apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude\nBy using the conventional definitions of the apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude, we can find the relationship between them:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nm &= -2.5\\log_{10}{\\frac{F}{F_0}} \\\\\n&= -2.5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2}\\times \\frac{4\\pi (10\\mathrm{pc})^2}{L_0} \\right) \\\\\n& =-2.5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L}{L_0}\\right) -2.5\\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{10\\mathrm{pc}}{r}\\right)^2\\\\\n& = M -5\\log_{10}(10\\mathrm{pc})+5\\log_{10}{r}\\\\\n& = M -5 + 5\\log_{10}{r}.\n\\end{align}\\] Then \\[\nM = m + 5 - 5\\log_{10} r.\n\\tag{6.13}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nCareful to the units in Equation 6.13!

    "text": "6.3 Notes on types of magnitude\nThe magnitude observed can depend on the sensitivity of the telescope or detector to the range of wavelengths. For instance, the human eye can observe in the visible part of the spectrum, but not in the IR or UV. Likewise, telescopes can have filters to observe different parts of the spectrum. Magnitude can therefore be specified for different wavelength intervals, i.e. observed with different coloured filters on the telescope.\n\nFor stars, the most commonly quoted magnitude is the visual magnitude, the magnitude in the visual part of the spectrum.\nAnother commonly used magnitude is the bolometric magnitude, which include the luminosity across the whole electromagnetic spectrum of wavelengths, whether observed or not. We will use this when performing some physics calculations.\nOne of the most common magnitude systems used in photometry is the UBV system, where magnitudes are measured through ultraviolet (U), blue (B) and visual (V) filters.\n\nThe magnitudes we mentioned so far, e.g. \\(M_\\odot = 4.74\\), are bolometric magnitudes.\nThe visual magnitude \\(V\\) and the bolometric magnitude \\(M_{bol}\\) (or just \\(M\\)) are related by the bolometric correction BC through the formula\n\\[\nM_{bol} - V = BC,\n\\tag{6.14}\\]\nwhere \\(BC&lt;0\\).\nIn a multicolour system, such as UBV, it is useful to introduce the colour index. This is the difference between two magnitudes of that system. Considering the UBV system, for instance:\n\nthe \\(U-B\\) color index of a star is the difference between its ultraviolet and blue magnitudes (\\(U-B=M_U-M_B\\))\nthe \\(B-V\\) color index of a star is the difference between its blue and visual magnitudes (\\(V-B=M_V-M_B\\)).\n\nWe will come back to this again in the next chapter."

    "text": "8.2 Black body radiation\n\nA body that totally absorbs all radiation that falls upon it is called a black-body. You can think of it as a perfect absorber of radiation.\nA black body is in thermal equilibrium, so it has a temperature \\(T\\).\nIf it absorbs energy then it must also re-radiate it to stay in thermal equilibrium.\nA black body is a perfect absorber but it is also a perfect emitter.\n\nWe anticipated that stars radiate different amounts of energy at different wavelengths. Let us assume that we can consider stars as black bodies.\nWhat is the distribution of radiation across wavelengths (or frequencies) that a black body emits?\n\nWe want to know the power emitted per unit wavelength \\(\\lambda\\), per unit area, per unit solid angle (steradian): the spectral radiance \\(B_\\lambda(\\lambda;T)\\).\nFor a perfect emitter, radiation is emitted:\n\nequally from the surface of an object\nisotropically over solid angle.\n\nThe emission spectra of black bodies (the energy emitted against the wavelength or frequency) depend only on their temperature \\(T\\).\nSo what is the form of the emission spectrum of a black body? Although the spectrum of black-body radiation was known observationally, its theoretical description has puzzled physicists at the end of the 19th Century and many attempts to describe this ran into trouble. It cannot be fully explained using classical physics, it requires quantum physics, as we will see in the following.\n\n8.2.1 Rayleigh-Jeans law\nLord Rayleigh used classical physics to predict the shape of the black body spectrum, which was later refined by Sir James Jeans.\nThe Rayleigh-Jeans law is a good approximation to the observed spectrum at long wavelength (low frequencies) \\(hc\\ll k_BT\\lambda\\).\n\\[\nB_\\lambda^\\mathrm{RJ}(\\lambda; T) = \\frac{2ck_B T}{\\lambda^4}\n\\tag{8.1}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLord Rayleigh (1842 - 1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSir James Jeans (1877 - 1946)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport numpy as np\nfrom astropy.constants import k_B, c, h\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import rc\nrc('text',usetex=True)\nrc('font',size=15)\nrc('figure',figsize=(8,6), dpi=300)\n\nl = np.linspace(0,3000,1000) # Wavelength, nm\nT = 4000 # Temperature, Kelvin\n\nB_rj=c.value* 2*k_B.value * T /(l*1e-9)**4; # 1e-9 to convert from nm to meters\n\nplt.plot(l, B_rj, label=\"Rayleigh-Jeans law\")\nplt.xlabel(r'Wavelength $\\lambda$ (nm)')\nplt.ylabel(r'Spectral Radiance $B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T=4000K)$ (Wm$^{-3}$sr$^{-1}$)')\nplt.title('Spectral radiance')\nplt.ylim([0,1e15])\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend();\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Spectral radiance plotted using the Rayleigh-Jeans law (Equation 8.1).\n\n\n\n\nThe Rayleigh-Jeans law has a big problem - the radiance keeps increasing indefinitely at short wavelengths (higher frequencies). If it were true the power emitted at short wavelengths would be infinite! This is known as the Ultraviolet Catastrophe, and indicates the failure of classical physics to explain the behaviour of thermal radiation.\n\n\n8.2.2 Wien’s approximation\nWien’s approximation, also referred to as Wien’s law (not to be confused with ‘Wien’s displacement law’), is a good model for the observed spectrum at short wavelength (high frequencies) \\(hc\\gg k_BT\\lambda\\), but it is not accurate at high wavelengths.

This means that their luminosity, radius and temperature of a star are not always the same. This means that a star will move across the Luminosity-Temperature plot of Figure 3.1 during its lifetime.\nSo where do stars fall on this plot? And how do they move around it during their lifetime?\nTwo astronomers independently devised ways to represent catalogued stars on a diagram, based on their observed properties:\nThey constructed the plot now known as a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, universally called an H-R diagram for short.\nWhy are we justified in giving the names “dwarfs” and “giants” to these classes?\nWe need Stellar Evolution to explain all this!\nWe have seen that on the main sequence, there are a range of star colours. We can use this to classify them.\nFilters are placed over the telescope to select a band. A photograph of a set of filters is shown in Figure 7.1.\nDifferent instruments have slightly different filters from different manufacturers. An example is shown in Figure 7.2.\nYou don’t have to memorise this for the course.\nIn the previous chapter we saw that black bodies emit at all wavelengths but the amount of light emitted at each wavelength is not the same. It depends on the temperature of the black body, which is related to the position of the peak and therefore to the colour of the black body (see Figure 7.3).\nYou can now see how observation through filters give us different information on the flux observed at different wavelength windows.\nBlack bodies emit a continuous spectrum: this means that light is emitted at all wavelengths. If this goes through a prism or diffraction grating, we are able to see the ‘rainbow’ pattern where light is divided into all its components (see Figure 8.1). We will come back to explaining the emission and absorption spectra in this figure shortly.\nBy 1890 stars were classified in order of the line strength of hydrogen :\nBy the end of the 19th Century it was possible to photograph the spectra of light from many stars.\nSo while the Colour Index is a straightforward objective measure of colour, it can be more useful to talk about the spectral class (or type) of a star.\nObservations from binary systems (where masses can be determined) indicate a relationship between mass and luminosity.\nWe find: \\[\n\\frac{L}{L_\\odot}\\approx \\left(\\frac{M}{M_\\odot}\\right)^\\alpha\n\\tag{10.1}\\]\nThe value of \\(\\alpha\\) depends on the fit used in the data, but is roughly \\(3.0 \\le \\alpha \\le 3.5\\)."

He observed that two of the missing yellow lines of the Solar spectrum had exactly the same wavelength as the two yellow lines emitted by sodium (salt) when sprinkled on a flame.\nWollaston and Fraunhofer showed that the continuum light from the Sun was absorbed at discrete wavelengths.\n\nTo understand this we need to answer one of our first questions: what are the stars made of?\n\nStars are mainly hydrogen\nHydrogen emits light only at particular emission lines when excited in the laboratory (see, for example, Figure 9.1)\nSo why do we see a continuous spectrum?\nWhy do we see absorption lines in the spectrum of stars?\nWhy do we see emission lines from regions of the sky nears stars?

The gravity is balanced by the internal pressure. The higher the temperature, the higher the thermal pressure (the atoms in the core will have higher kinetic energy).\n\n\nWhy are more massive stars on the main sequence more luminous?\nThe nuclear reaction rate in a star is very sensitive to the core temperature. Even a slight increase in temperature makes the nuclear reactions occur at a MUCH higher rate. So a slight increase in the mass of the star produces a large increase in the star’s luminosity."

Assume for now that \\(r_1&gt;r_2\\), i.e. star 1 is bigger.\n\nConsider the flux received:\nWhen both stars are visible, \\(F_0 = F_1 + F_2\\)\nWhen 2 moves behind 1, the flux is \\(F = F_1\\)\nWhen 1 moves behind 2, the flux is\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF' &= F_1\\left(1-\\frac{r_2^2}{r_1^2}\\right) + F_2 \\\\\n  & = \\frac{4\\pi r_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi d^2}\\left(1-\\frac{r_2^2}{r_1^2}\\right) + \\frac{4\\pi r_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}{4\\pi d^2} \\\\\n  & = \\frac{\\sigma}{d^2}\\left((r_1^2-r_2^2)T_1^4 + r_2^2T_2^4\\right) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\sigma}{d^2}\\left(r_1^2T_1^4 + r_2^2(T_2^4 - T_1^4)\\right)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe smaller star obscures a chunk of the larger, but it adds its own light. If it is higher temperature then it will be replaced by a brighter patch.\n\nIf \\(T_2&gt;T_1\\), then \\(F' &gt; F_1\\): secondary minimum - the cooler star moves behind the hotter\nIf \\(T_2&lt;T_1\\), then \\(F' &lt; F_1\\): primary minimum - the hotter star moves behind the cooler.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: Light curve in eclipsing binaries. When the smaller star partially eclipses the bigger one, it replaces the eclipsed section with its brightness.\n\n\nIt can be shown that, if\n\n\\(F_0\\) is the flux when no eclipse is happening\n\\(F_p\\) is the primary eclipse flux\n\\(F_s\\) is the secondary eclipse flux,\n\nthen\n\\[\n\\frac{F_0 - F_p}{F_0 - F_s} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^4,\n\\tag{8.7}\\]\nwhere \\(T_1\\) is the temperature of the larger star, and \\(T_2\\) the smaller. From the measure of the fluxes we can find the ratio of the temperatures.\nSo in eclipsing, spectroscopic binaries we can get\n\nthe orbital period (from either light curve or spectroscopy)\nspeed of the stars in orbit (from spectroscopy), which can be used to find the size of the orbit\nthere is enough information to calculate the mass of the two stars.\n\nThe light curve gives us even more information, allowing us to compute the size of each star! This can be done by measuring the time of the transit, and combining with the speed measured via doppler line shift."

It states that the structure of a star, in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium, with all energy derived from nuclear reactions, is uniquely determined by its mass and the distribution of chemical elements throughout its interior.\nIn Chapter 2 we already gave an introduction to the spectral classification, based on the chemical elements present in the stars, and we anticipated that these can be determined through spectroscopy.\nSpectroscopy is the method for identifying the elements by their spectral lines.\nRemember KircHhoff’s Laws from Chapter 2 (see Figure 8.4):\nKirchoff’s laws tell us that the absorption lines indicate the presence of a cooler layer of diffuse gas, on top of a hot layer of denser gas.\nIn order to understand the structure and the evolution of a star, it is therefore important to study its chemical composition both of the core and of its atmosphere. Let’s start by looking at the Sun.\nWhen we observe the Sun, we see light from:\nin descending order of contribution.\nWe talked in Chapter 2 about absorption and emission spectra, and how these can be used in spectroscopy to learn about the composition of stars.\nLet’s look at a star spectrum, such as Figure 9.6.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\chi &= hc R_\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{\\infty^2}\\right)\\\\\n&= E_{\\infty}-E_1=\\frac{13.6}{n^2}\\mathrm{eV}.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{8.1}\\]\nThis is the energy required to remove an electron from an energy level \\(n\\) to the level \\(m=\\infty\\) (where it is no longer bound to the nucleus).\nWhen the electron has been knocked out of the atom, an ion is left."

However, we can simplify the explanation using the Bohr Model of the atom. This works well for Hydrogen, and sometimes for other elements too. Since most of the Sun is made of Hydrogen, we will stick to this simple picture for the moment.\nIn the Bohr model:\n\nElectrons, bound in atoms, are only allowed certain energies\nThese energies correspond to certain ‘orbits’ around the nucleus (Figure 7.1)\nThese orbits must have angular momenta equal to an integer multiple of a universal constant – Planck’s constant\nOnly photons with energies corresponding to differences between energy levels can be emitted or absorbed\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Representation of the Bohr model with the first three orbits of the hydrogen atom.\n\n\nThe energy of the n-th level of hydrogen is given by the relationship \\[\nE_n = -\\frac{13.6}{n^2}\\,\\mathrm{eV},\n\\tag{7.1}\\] and they are represented in Figure 7.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\neV is an electron-volt, a small unit of energy (not voltage!) - \\(1\\, \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602\\times 10^{-19}\\, \\mathrm{J}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Energy levels of the Hydrogen atom.\n\n\nThe energies are negative because they refer to ‘bound states’, where the electrons are in their orbits around the nucleus.\nFor a transition between level \\(m\\) (final state) and level \\(n\\) (initial state), the photon emitted or absorbed would have energy corresponding to the energy difference between the states \\[\n\\Delta E_{mn} = E_m - E_n = 13.6\\, \\mathrm{eV}\\left(\\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{m^2}\\right).\n\\tag{7.2}\\]\nFrom quantum theory we can relate the energy to the wavelength: \\(\\Delta E_{mn} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{mn}}\\).\nSo this means we can calculate the wavelength of the emitted photon: \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{mn}} = R_\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{m^2}\\right).\n\\tag{7.3}\\]\nAll the constants are hidden in \\(R_\\infty\\).

We account for this by proposing that stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence and less time in the other states.\nHow old is the Sun?\nWe know from radioisotope dating that the Solar System has existed for about 4.6 billion years.\nWhat powers the Sun?\nWe have verified the general picture of stars as fusion-powered for most of their lifetimes. But let’s back-track and look again at that energy from gravitational collapse, because we had asked the question: Why and how do stars form?\nWe know that stars have a finite lifetime, so they must have been born at some point in the past. For the Sun this was about 4.6 billion years ago. Gravity is the key player.\nWhat did it form from? Interstellar gas cloud.\nThe galaxy is full of Hydrogen and Helium produced in the big bang, and dust and gas left over from previous generations of stars (Population II).\nLet’s compare some densities.\nThe density in interstellar clouds is very low, so we need a lot of mass (\\(&gt;100 M_\\odot\\)) to collapse under gravity."

While travelling toward the outer part of the star, photons are constantly being absorbed and re-emitted by atoms. They “random walk” their way out of a star.\n\nHydrogen is converted to Helium in the core\nVery little Helium escapes\nBoth radiation and convection transport heat energy from the core to the surface\n\nHow efficient radiative transport is then depends on the absorbing power of the medium (called opacity).\n\nIf the medium absorbs a lot of photons, then the radiative transport is low and photons can’t travel quickly and far.\n\nWhether radiative or convection mechanism dominate depends on the mass, temperature and structure of the stars.\n\nOpacity is the capacity of absorbing photons to ionize or excite atoms.\nIn low mass stars, like the Sun, the outer envelope temperature is not high enough and hydrogen is not ionized. Soigher energy photons coming from the interior of the star are easily absorbed by the hydrogen - the outer portions of low mass stars have high opacity, and are thus convective.\nIn high mass stars, the temperature is high enough that the hydrogen stays ionized in the outer part, so radiation is not so easily absorbed - the outer layer of high mass stars is radiative.\nThe nuclear fusion mechanism in high mass stars is mainly CNO cycle, which has a strong temperature dependance, so it is too strong for radiative transport - the core of high mass stars is convective.\n\nFigure 9.3 shows different energy transport mechanisms taking place inside stars of different masses.\n\nStars of mass similar to the one of the Sun have a central bulk where energy is radiated, while the outer layer is a convection zone\nStars with \\(M&gt;1.5M_\\odot\\) are convective in their centers because the CNO cycle is more dependent on the temperature as compared to the pp chain\nStars with mass \\(&lt;0.5 M_\\odot\\) are not hot enough to trigger nuclear fusion, so their energy transport mechanism is mainly convective.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Stellar interiors.\n\n\n# Recap\n\nStars like the Sun are mainly powered by nuclear fusion (for \\(M&gt;0.08 M_\\odot\\))\nThe main nuclear fusion mechanisms are p-p and CNO cycles\nProtostars are formed when a ISM cloud collapses, spinning and attracting more surrounding material, while slowly getting hotter\nWhen the protostar is hot enough, nuclear fusion of hydrogen begins and the protostar becomes a star\nThe liberation of gravitational energy from the collapse, converted to heat and powering the star, is regulated by the Kelvin-Helmoltz timescale\nPre-main-sequence stars move on the HR diagram following Hayashi and Henyey tracks\nThe virial theorem states that for a stable self-gravitating mass, the kinetic energy is half the gravitational potential energy (remember the minus sign)\nAn ISM cloud collapses if its mass is larger than the Jeans mass\nThe interior of stars can transport energy by radiative transport and convection."

However, when switching to burning other chemical sources, the KH timescale can become relevant again as gravitational energy plays a role again. We will discuss this further during the rest of the chapter.\npo\nHere is a source to play with that is useful for the following, where we will see how stars of different masses evolve. Try to run it for low-mass stars and high-mass stars, monitoring the different stages of the evolution and how the position on the HR diagram, the radius, the temperature and the luminosity of the stars change during the simulation.\nEvolution is similar to that of low mass stars but there is added gravitational pressure due to the higher mass and a convective core that mixes the elements.

Why doesn’t the collapse continue down indefinitely, to a point?\nBased on the ideal gas law \\[\nP = nRT/V,\n\\]\nwe need a finite temperature \\(T\\) to create pressure. Since a star is losing heat into space, the heat energy must be continually replenished.\nWhen the fuel runs out, the star will resume contracting, since there is no longer a thermal pressure to balance gravity.\nSupernovae are classified into different types depending on whether they show hydrogen in their spectrum, as we already anticipated in Chapter 3, when we talked about binaries.\nType I supernovae are further classified in different categories based on the presence of other chemical elements (see Figure 9.1).\nTypes Ia,b,c indicate that different mechanisms are at work.\nNeed \\(&gt; 8M_\\odot\\) for core collapse to allow carbon and oxygen burning.\nAs the shock wave travels out through stellar envelope, carrying energy and momentum, it encounters material of ever decreasing density.\nEnergy and momentum is conserved. Shock wave passing into lower density region transmits momentum to a progressively lower mass of material per unit surface area of the wave.\nFrom the definition of momentum \\(p=mv,\\) we know that roughly the same \\(p\\) and smaller \\(m\\) results in larger \\(v\\). Low-density outer layers attain huge expulsion velocity.\nObservationally, supernovae brighten rapidly to \\(\\sim10^{9}\\,L_{\\odot}\\) in about 10 days, then slowly dim over about 100 days, i.e. they may briefly outshine their entire host galaxy.\nEnergy source is the release of gravitational potential energy by the contraction of the core.\nGravitational potential energy of a uniform sphere is roughly \\[\nE_G=-\\frac{GM^{2}}{r}.\n\\] So the energy released by contraction, from the core initially having radius \\(r_1\\) (when the contraction starts, assuming no more mass is lost) to the neutron star of radius \\(r_2\\), is roughly \\[\n\\Delta E\\approx\\left(\\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{1}}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{2}}\\right).\n\\] Since \\(r_{1}\\gg r_{2}\\) \\[\n\\Delta E\\approx \\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{2}}\n\\tag{13.1}\\]\nWhere does all this energy go?"

    "text": "10 White dwarfs on the HR diagram\nWilliam Herschel started building his own telescopes and lenses, not being satisfied with commercial ones. He built his first large telescope in 1774 and during his career he observed over 5000 nebulae. In 1781 he discovered Uranus, and after that he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Societ and started working as a Court Astronomer for George III.\nWilliam Herschel was also the first one to do (rudimentally) astronomical spectrophotometry, using prisms and instruments to measure the temperature of light diffracted at different wavelenghts. One day, while doing this, he noticed that beyond the rainbow diffracted by the prism, where seemingly there was no diffracted light, the temperature was still changing: he discovered the infrared light.\nCaroline Herschel got passionate about astronomy while assisting his brother William in his observations and in creating the catalogues. She was actually the first of the Hereschels siblings to discover a nebula, even though she usually does not get enough credit for that!\nAt that time, in 1783, William was focused on the studies of double stars and asked Caroline to scan the sky in search of interesting objects. That is when, on the same night, she discovered both a nebula that was not in the Messier catalogue and the galaxy Messier110 (Figure 10.4), a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy.\nCaroline also realised that William’s methods of building the catalogue and searching for nebulae (organized by constellation as per Flamsteed’s catalogue), were not really efficient and precise. She created her own catalogue, organizing observed astronomical objects by north polar distance. On top of that, she revised the whole Flamsteed’s catalogue, which presented some errors, and published a catalogue containing an index of all the observations made by Flamsteed, a list of errata, and a list of over 560 stars that were not included until then. This work was called Catalogue of Stars, Taken from Mr. Flamsteed’s Observations Contained in the Second Volume of the Historia Coelestis, and Not Inserted in the British Catalogue. She published more astronomical catalogues during her career, and two of them are still in use today.\nCaroline was also the first woman to discover a comet. She discovered eight comets during her career, and her work was internationally recognised.\nShe was the first female professional astronomer in England and the first woman to:\nOn her 96th birthday (1846), the King of Prussia presented her with a Gold Medal for Science for her contributions to science.\nWe have seen that the central pressure in a star is given by (Equation 11.2) \\[\n\\begin{equation}\n  P_{\\text{c}}=\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)^{1/3}GM^{2/3}\\rho^{4/3},\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{11.1}\\] and in a stellar remnant where both electrons and protons are non-relativistic, the dominant degeneracy pressure is due to electrons, given by (Equation 12.10) \\[\n\\begin{equation}\n{P_{\\text{Qe}}=\\frac{\\beta}{2} \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{m_{\\text{e}}}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_{\\text{p}}}\\right)^{5/3}}\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{11.2}\\] where \\(\\beta\\) is a dimensionless constant of order unity.\n(For the idealised case used for the derivation in Chapter 8, we assumed \\(\\beta = 2\\), then we added this factor at the end).\nA stellar remnant where the self-gravity is balanced by electron degeneracy pressure is called a white dwarf.\nWhite dwarfs have no energy sources, so energy radiated to space is not replenished. White dwarfs cool down completely over very long timescales. When the white dwarf reaches ambient temperature it no longer shines, and is called a black dwarf.\nWe have shown that the radius of a white dwarf (Equation 11.5 and Equation 11.6) is \\(R_{\\text{WD}}\\propto M^{-1/3}\\).\nWhen does the non-relativistic approximation fail? When \\[\n    \\begin{align}\n      v&\\rightarrow c\\\\\n      p=mv&\\rightarrow mc.\n    \\end{align}\n\\tag{13.1}\\]\nWe know from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that \\[\n\\begin{equation}\n  p_{x}\\approx\\Delta p_x\\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta x}\\approx\\hbar \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_{\\text{p}}}\\right)^{1/3}.\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{13.2}\\]\nSo at the Chandrasekhar mass limit (the mass at which relativistic effects become relevant) \\[\np\\approx\\hbar \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_{\\text{p}}}\\right)^{1/3}\\approx m_{\\text{e}}c.\n\\tag{13.3}\\]\nFrom our expression for the White Dwarf density (Equation 11.3) we can now write \\[\n\\hbar\\left(\\frac{1}{m_{\\text{p}}}\\frac{4\\pi}{3\\beta^{3}}G^{3}\\frac{m_{\\text{e}}^{3}m_{\\text{p}}^{5}}{\\hbar^{6}}M^{2}\\right)^{1/3}\\approx\nm_{\\text{e}}c.\n\\tag{13.4}\\]\nWe rearrange and solve for the stellar mass, \\(M\\), to give \\[\n\\begin{align}\n      \\hbar^{3}\\frac{1}{m_{\\text{p}}}\\frac{4\\pi}{3\\beta^{3}}G^{3}\\frac{m_{\\text{e}}^{3}m_{\\text{p}}^{5}}{\\hbar^{6}}M^{2}&\\approx\n    m_{\\text{e}}^{3}c^{3}\\nonumber\\\\\n    \\frac{4\\pi}{3\\beta^{3}}G^{3}\\frac{m_{\\text{p}}^{4}}{\\hbar^{3}}M^{2}&\\approx\n    c^{3}\\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{13.5}\\] \\[\n\\begin{equation}\nM_{\\text{Ch}}\\approx\\left(\\frac{3}{4\\pi}\\right)^{1/2}\\frac{1}{m_{\\text{p}}^{2}}\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\hbar c}{G}\\right)^{3/2}\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{13.6}\\]\nWhat happens above the Chandrasekhar mass limit?\nStellar remnants in close binary systems may gravitationally attract material away from their companion stars. This material flows onto the surface of the remnant in a process called accretion.\nConsider the gravitational potential in a binary system. The region of space around a star in which material is gravitationally bound to that star is called its Roche Lobe.\nIn a binary system, these touch at the system’s Lagrange point where the gravitational effect of each star exactly balances (Figure 15.1)\nSuppose that one member of the binary system is a compact object (e.g. a white dwarf), and that the other member is large enough (e.g. a giant star) or close enough that it completely fills its own Roche Lobe, as shown in Figure 15.2.\nMatter will “spill across” from the companion star’s Roche Lobe at the Lagrange point, stream into the white dwarf’s Roche Lobe and fall towards the white dwarf, as represented in Figure 15.3.\nSince the whole system is rotating (as the stars orbit around each other), the flowing stream of matter possesses angluar momentum.\nTherefore, it doesn’t fall directly down onto the white dwarf, but misses the surface and swings around it, forming a spiral of in-falling matter."

    "text": "11 Recap on electron degeneracy pressure\nWe have seen that above the Chandrasekhar mass, electrons in a white dwarf become relativistic and electron degeneracy pressure \\(P_{Q_e}\\) is unable to balance the force of gravity to prevent further collapse.\nTherefore the remnant continues to collapse to smaller radii and higher densities. In our diagram (Figure 13.2, also reported below for convenience), as the density \\(\\log\\rho\\) increases during further collapse, the central pressure due to gravity increases \\(P_c\\propto\\rho^{4/3}\\).\nIn Chapter 8 we mentioned that above the Chandrasekar mass limit the degeneracy pressure of electrons starts not being sufficient to keep the white dwarf from collapsing.\nWhat about the protons?\nSo in reality the stellar remnant is supported by degenerate neutrons. However, since electric charge plays no part in the process, and the mass of the neutron \\(\\approx\\) mass of the proton, we can use expressions involving protons as an adequate substitute for neutrons.\nWe have shown that our equations for \\(P_{\\text{Qe}}\\) and \\(P_{\\text{Qp}}\\) are identical with the exception of particle mass \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  P_{\\text{Qe}}&=\n  \\frac{\\beta\\hbar^{2}}{2m_{\\text{e}}}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_{\\text{p}}}\\right)^{5/3},\\\\\nP_{\\text{Qp}}& = \\frac{\\beta\\hbar^{2}}{2m_{\\text{p}}}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_{\\text{p}}}\\right)^{5/3}.\n  \\end{align}\n\\tag{13.1}\\]\n[Note that the \\(\\beta/2\\) factor was introduced to generalise our original derivation of these quantities]\nWe can therefore re-use all our analysis from white dwarfs except with proton (\\(\\simeq\\) neutron) degeneracy pressure instead of electron degeneracy pressure.\n## Neutron star density\nRemember that (from Equation 11.3) \\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho_{\\text{WD}}=\\frac{4\\pi}{3\\beta^{3}}G^{3}\\frac{m_{\\text{e}}^{3}m_{\\text{p}}^{5}}{\\hbar^{6}}M^{2}.\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nTherefore \\[\n\\rho_{\\text{NS}}=\\left(\\frac{m_{\\text{p}}}{m_{\\text{e}}}\\right)^{3}\\rho_{\\text{WD}}=\\frac{4\\pi}{3\\beta^{3}}G^{3}\\frac{m_{p}^{8}}{\\hbar^{6}}M^{2}.\n\\tag{13.2}\\]\n## Neutron star radius\nSimilarly, since (from Equation 11.5) \\[\n\\begin{equation}\nR_{\\text{WD}}=\\left(\\frac{3}{4\\pi}\\right)^{2/3}\\frac{\\beta}{G}\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{m_{\\text{e}}m_{\\text{p}}^{5/3}}M^{-1/3},\n    %\\rho=\\frac{M}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}}\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{13.3}\\]\nwe again re-use all our analysis from white dwarfs, except with proton (\\(\\simeq\\) neutron) degeneracy pressure instead of electron degeneracy pressure: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  R_{\\text{NS}}&=\\frac{m_{\\text{e}}}{m_{\\text{p}}}R_{\\text{WD}}\\nonumber\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{3}{4\\pi}\\right)^{2/3}\\beta\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{Gm_{\\text{p}}^{8/3}}M^{-1/3}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\nonumber \\\\\n  &\\approx 1.2\\times\n10^{3}\\left(\\frac{M}{M_{\\odot}}\\right)^{-1/3}\\,\\text{m}\\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{13.4}\\]\nIf the magnetic axis is inclined to the rotational axis of the neutron star, these beams of radiation will sweep through space like the beams of light from a lighthouse as in Figure 16.3."

    "text": "15.6 Pulsars\n\nA neutron star has an extremely strong magnetic field, and can rotate extremely rapidly. Since the field is `frozen in’, it is also dragged round by the rotation.\nConsider a stationary point in space just above the surface of a swiftly- rotating neutron star. The neutron star’s magnetic field will rapidly sweep past this point as it rotates, i.e. locally there will be a rapidly time-varying magnetic field.\nA time-varying magnetic field gives rise to an electric field (Faraday’s Law: \\(dB/dt\\) gives \\(E\\) ). Therefore, there will be a strong electric field above the neutron star’s surface.\nThe strong electric field accelerates charged particles to extremely high (relativistic) velocities.\nThe plasma physics of this situation is highly complicated and not completely understood. However, the general outcome is the production of strong beams of electrons, which stream out from the neutron star’s magnetic poles, where the field is strongest (see Figure 15.6 and Figure 15.7).\nThe particles travel along the (curving) magnetic field lines. These accelerating charges emit (non-thermal) curvature radiation (mostly radio waves). Since they are travelling at relativistic speeds, relativistic beaming occurs (i.e. the `headlamp effect’). Strong beams of radiation are produced in the direction of the electrons’ travel, i.e. along the magnetic axis of the neutron star.\nWe observe similar beaming, on a vastly larger scale, in jets from active galactic nuclei (see ItC lectures) and black holes (see Chapter 11).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.6: Schematic representation of electrons beaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.7: Jet from active galaxy M87.\n\n\nIf the magnetic axis is inclined to the rotational axis of the neutron star, these beams of radiation will sweep through space like the beams of light from a lighthouse as in Figure 15.8.\n\n\n\nFigure 15.8: Motion of light beams from a lighthouse.\n\n\n\nIf an observer happens to be located such that one of these beams points directly towards them at some point in the neutron star’s rotation, they will see a flash of radiation once per rotation as the beam sweeps past. These pulses of radiation give rise to the name of this phenomenon: a pulsar.\nPulsars are extremely regular (as accurate as atomic clocks), and are observed to have periods of milliseconds to seconds. Millisecond pulsars are rotating faster than the centrifugal break-up limit of white dwarfs (\\(t \\approx 0.5\\) s), so they must be neutron stars.\n\n\n15.6.1 \\(P-\\dot{P}\\) diagram\nPlotting the period \\(P\\) and spindown \\(\\dot{P}\\) of pulsars (Figure 15.9) reveals features of their population.\n\n\n\nFigure 15.9: \\(P-\\dot{P}\\) diagram, showing period \\(P\\) and spindown \\(\\dot{P}\\).\n\n\n\nNewly-born pulsars have \\(P\\sim 1\\,\\)ms and large spindowns \\(\\dot{P}&gt;10^{-13}\\,\\) s/s.\nMost pulsars have \\(0.1&lt;P&lt;1\\,\\)s and \\(\\dot{P}\\sim 10^{-15}\\)s/s as they have been spinning down for a long time.\nRecycled pulsars have short periods but very low spindowns (bottom left). They were spun up by mass transfer from a binary companion.\n\n\n\n15.6.2 Changes in pulsar period\nThe pulses of radiation from a pulsar are extremely regular in the sense that they are highly predictable. However, they do not arrive at a perfectly constant rate. The pulse rate is observed to decline slowly.\n\nSuppose the rate of change of the pulse period \\(\\tau\\) with time is \\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d\\tau}{dt}=\\dot{\\tau}.\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{15.12}\\]\nThen we can define the characteristic spin-down time \\(t_{\\text{s}}\\) as the length of time it would take for the pulsar’s rotation to cease, if its current rate of decline continued unchanged: \\[\n\\begin{equation}\nt_{\\text{s}}=\\frac{\\tau}{\\dot{\\tau}}\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{15.13}\\]\nFor observed pulsars, \\(t_{\\text{s}}\\) is measured to be \\(\\sim 10^{4}\\) to \\(10^{7}\\) years.\n\n\n\n15.6.3 Why do pulsars spin down?\n\nFor isolated pulsars, the only source of energy is that stored in the “flywheel” energy reservoir of their rotation. Energy is carried away by the pulsar’s emission of radiation - this has to come from the store of rotational energy, which will gradually be exhausted, leading to progressively slower rotation.\nHence we might expect that all pulsars older than about 10 million years should have spun down to a halt, and no longer emit their characteristic pulsar beams.\nShort period (millisecond) pulsars would then also have to be very young, and should still be surrounded by their supernova remnants, e.g. the Crab pulsar, with \\(t = 33\\) ms, embedded in the Crab Nebula supernova remnant (see previous chapter).\nBut we do observe older millisecond pulsars without any supernova remnant.\n\nWhy haven’t they spun down to much longer rotation periods?\n\nThese pulsars are (or were until recently) part of an accreting binary system. The accretion flow transfers angular momentum to the pulsar, causing it to spin-up to near the centrifugal break-up limit. Such objects are known as re-cycled pulsars.\n\n\n\n15.6.4 Case study: the “Double Pulsar” system, PSR J0737-3039\n\n\n\nThe “Double Pulsar” system, PSR J0737-3039\n\n\n\nTwo pulsars, A and B, in a binary system of orbital period 2.4 hrs. \\[\n\\begin{align}\nA:&\\,M=1.34M_{\\odot},\\,\\tau=23\\,\\text{ms}\\nonumber\\\\\nB:&\\,M=1.25M_{\\odot},\\,\\tau=2.8\\,\\text{s}\\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nStar A went supernova first and formed a long period (\\(\\sim\\) seconds) pulsar. As time progressed, star B aged and proceeded to the giant phase. An accretion stream formed from star B to pulsar A, transferring angular momentum and spinning-up pulsar A to a short (\\(\\sim\\) milliseconds) rotation period. Star B then went supernova, forming a long period (\\(\\sim\\) seconds) pulsar.\nFortuitous alignment means that from Earth we see both neutron stars as pulsars. The system is also almost exactly edge-on, and so features eclipses. Occultation and scattering of one pulsar’s beam by the other pulsar gives us a rare insight into the plasma conditions near the pulsars and should help us investigate the pulse emission mechanism. Orbital measurements also provide extremely precise tests of General Relativity.\nPSR J0737-3039 is an almost perfect astrophysics laboratory!"

    "text": "18.1 How can we tell the difference between accretion onto a neutron star and onto a black hole?\n\nAccreting material piles up on the surface of a neutron star, leading to periodic, very bright X-ray bursts (in the same way as accreting white dwarfs give nova outbursts).\nSome compact X-ray accretion sources do not show burst emission profiles. It is believed that these systems contain black holes: the black hole has no `solid’ surface on which material can pile up - instead the accreting matter slips beneath the event horizon and becomes hidden from view."

    "text": "19.2 Gravitational Lensing\nGeneral Relativity predicts that light is affected by gravity in the same way that matter is: light rays will be deflected by the presence of gravitating matter. In this way, mass can act as a gravitational lens, focusing light from distant sources. The lensing effect is most pronounced for extremely dense objects like black holes.\n\n\n\nFigure 19.2: Principle of gravitational lensing.\n\n\nBlack holes may be detectable by the distortion they cause in space time bending the light from more distant sources. We call this effect gravitational lensing. Some promising black hole candidates have been identified, but as yet there are no unambiguous detections."

Larger BHs make louder signals so these tend to be heavier than ones we know about in the galaxy.\nA binary neutron star coalescence was detected in 2017, which revealed that these are responsible for short gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae which produce very heavy elements like gold.\n\nAs black holes in a tight binary system radiate gravitational waves the orbit shrinks in a run-away process.

The gravity is balanced by the internal pressure. The higher the temperature, the higher the thermal pressure (the atoms in the core will have higher kinetic energy).\n\n\nWhy are more massive stars on the main sequence more luminous?\nThe nuclear reaction rate in a star is very sensitive to the core temperature. Even a slight increase in temperature makes the nuclear reactions occur at a MUCH higher rate. So a slight increase in the mass of the star produces a large increase in the star’s luminosity."

    "text": "16.1 Changes in pulsar period\nThe pulses of radiation from a pulsar are extremely regular in the sense that they are highly predictable. However, they do not arrive at a perfectly constant rate. The pulse rate is observed to decline slowly.\n\nSuppose the rate of change of the pulse period \\(P\\) with time is \\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dP}{dt}=\\dot{P}.\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{16.1}\\]\nThen we can define the characteristic spin-down time \\(t_{\\text{s}}\\) as the length of time it would take for the pulsar’s rotation to cease, if its current rate of decline continued unchanged: \\[\n\\begin{equation}\nt_{\\text{s}}=\\frac{P}{\\dot{P}}\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{16.2}\\]\nFor observed pulsars, \\(t_{\\text{s}}\\) is measured to be \\(\\sim 10^{4}\\) to \\(10^{7}\\) years.\n\n\n16.1.1 \\(P-\\dot{P}\\) diagram\nPlotting the period \\(P\\) and spindown \\(\\dot{P}\\) of pulsars (Figure 16.4) reveals features of their population.\n\n\n\nFigure 16.4: \\(P-\\dot{P}\\) diagram, showing period \\(P\\) and spindown \\(\\dot{P}\\).\n\n\n\nNewly-born pulsars have \\(P\\sim 1\\,\\)ms and large spindowns \\(\\dot{P}&gt;10^{-13}\\,\\) s/s.\nMost pulsars have \\(0.1&lt;P&lt;1\\,\\)s and \\(\\dot{P}\\sim 10^{-15}\\)s/s as they have been spinning down for a long time.\nRecycled pulsars have short periods but very low spindowns (bottom left). They were spun up by mass transfer from a binary companion.\n\n\n\n16.1.2 Why do pulsars spin down?\n\nFor isolated pulsars, the only source of energy is that stored in the “flywheel” energy reservoir of their rotation. Energy is carried away by the pulsar’s emission of radiation - this has to come from the store of rotational energy, which will gradually be exhausted, leading to progressively slower rotation.\nHence we might expect that all pulsars older than about 10 million years should have spun down to a halt, and no longer emit their characteristic pulsar beams.\nShort period (millisecond) pulsars would then also have to be very young, and should still be surrounded by their supernova remnants, e.g. the Crab pulsar, with \\(t = 33\\) ms, embedded in the Crab Nebula supernova remnant (see previous chapter).\nBut we do observe older millisecond pulsars without any supernova remnant.\n\nWhy haven’t they spun down to much longer rotation periods?\n\nThese pulsars are (or were until recently) part of an accreting binary system. The accretion flow transfers angular momentum to the pulsar, causing it to spin-up to near the centrifugal break-up limit. Such objects are known as re-cycled pulsars."

Star B then went supernova, forming a long period (\\(\\sim\\) seconds) pulsar.\nFortuitous alignment means that from Earth we see both neutron stars as pulsars. The system is also almost exactly edge-on, and so features eclipses. Occultation and scattering of one pulsar’s beam by the other pulsar gives us a rare insight into the plasma conditions near the pulsars and should help us investigate the pulse emission mechanism.
