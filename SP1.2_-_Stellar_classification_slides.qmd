# Radius, luminosity and temperature of stars

We have developed relationships between the radius, luminosity and temperature of stars.
Since the three are related by Stefan-Boltzmann's law, not all combinations are possible. Let's see what we can expect to find when we look at real stars.

Stars have very wide ranges of luminosity, so it will be helpful to work with the logarithm of

\begin{align}
L &= 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \\
\log_{10} L &= \log_{10}(4\pi\sigma) + 2\log_{10}(R) + 4\log_{10}T
\end{align}

We can plot a graph of $y=\log_{10} L$ against $x=-\log_{10} T$ for some value of $R,$ and we should get a straight line.

We will see shortly why there is a negative sign.

```{python}
#| slideshow: {slide_type: subslide}
#| label: fig-luminosity-temperature-fixedr-plot
#| fig-cap: "Log-log plot of luminosity vs temperature for different values of the radius R."
import numpy as np
from numpy import linspace, logspace, log10, pi
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.figure(dpi=300)
sigma = 5.671e-8
for r in [1e10, 5e9, 1e9, 5e8]: # radius, m
    T=logspace(log10(1000),log10(20000),100)
    L=4.0*pi*sigma*r**2*T**4
    #L = 10**(log10(4.0*pi*sigma) + 2*log10(r) + 4*log10(T))
    plt.loglog(T,L, label=f'R={r:3.0e} m')
    #plt.plot(-log10(T), log10(L), label=f'r={r:3.0e} m')
    
plt.xlim(plt.xlim()[::-1])
plt.xlabel('$T$ [K]')
plt.ylabel('$L$ [W]')
plt.title('Luminosity - temperature')
plt.grid(True,which='both',alpha=0.4)
plt.legend();
```

We see that for each radius $R$ there is a straight line relationship when plotted on logarithmic axes.

Lower radii lie on lines toward the bottom of the plot.

What can we tell from this plot, and from the Stefan-Boltzmann law?
- If two stars have the same radius (lie on the same coloured line in @fig-luminosity-temperature-fixedr-plot), then the hotter one will have higher luminosity (the temperature increases from left to right in the plot)
- If two stars have the same temperature (lie on the same line parallel to the y axis), then the larger one must be more luminous
- If two stars have the same luminosity (lie on the same line parallel to the x axis), then the larger one is cooler.

We know also that stars are not static, they change and evolve with time. This means that their luminosity, radius and temperature of a star are not always the same. This means that a star will move across the Luminosity-Temperature plot of @fig-luminosity-temperature-fixedr-plot during its lifetime.

So where do stars fall on this plot?

# The Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram
Two astronomers independently devised ways to represent catalogued stars on a diagram, based on their observed properties:

- Ejnar HERTZSPRUNG (Denmark 1873 – 1967)
- Henry Norris RUSSELL (USA, 1877 – 1957)

They constructed the plot now known as a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, universally called an __H-R diagram__ for short.

![H-R diagram: Luminosity vs Temperature](img/HR_LT_basic.png){#fig-HR-luminosity-temperature}

- Stars are found to cluster in distinct areas of the HR diagram
- 80% to 90% of stars lie on a strip called the __Main Sequence__
- There are other branches of stars: __White Dwarfs, Giants and Supergiants__
- Remember that the temperature (x-axis) decreases as we go from left to right
- We use the H-R diagram to understand stellar evolution

_Why are we justified in giving the names "dwarfs" and "giants" to these classes?_

## A real HR diagram

![Gaia HR diagram. Image credit: Gaia Collaboration, _Observational Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams_, A&A 616 (2018)](img/HR_Gaia.png){#fig-gaia-HR-diagram}

- Over 1.3 billion stars contained in Gaia Data Release 2
- Note the colour scale is non-linear - white/yellow regions are more populated
- Axes are colour index ($G_{BP} - G_{RP}$ Blue - Red magnitude) vs absolute magnitude ($M_G$): We know these are related to temperature and luminosity
- We can see the main sequence, giants, and white dwarfs clearly
- There are other less populated clusters too: we will see what they mean for stellar evolution

Here is an annotated HR diagram showing temperature and luminosity along with magnitude and colour index.

![H-R diagram showing temperature and luminosity along with magnitude and colour index.](img/HR_L_CI.png){#fig-HR-diagram-LT-CM}

## Interpretation of the HR diagram

- Only certain combinations of luminosity and temperature are allowed
- The HR diagram shows stars with a wide range of ages
- Most stars sit on the main sequence
- Let's assume that stars move around on the HR diagram, from one class to another, as they evolve

What does this tell us?

- We are looking at a snapshot of the stellar population
- Stars follow 'tracks' on the HR diagram over their lifetime
- Clusters in the HR diagram are stars at similar stages of their lives
- The number of stars in each part of the diagram is proportional to the duration of that stage of their evolution

# The Main Sequence

- The main sequence is the most populated part of the HR diagram (80-90% of stars). We can deduce that stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence.
- The main sequence has most variation from top-left to botton-right, along a line of roughly constant radius. (This is not exact as the is a range of stellar radii)
- The top-left blue stars are hotter and more luminous, and therefore require more power
- The bottom-right red stars are much dimmer and cooler
- Hot blue stars are using up their fuel much more quickly
- We will see later the implications for their evolution

## The main sequence: limits

There are two cut-offs to the main sequence:
- At the top: extremely luminous stars blow off material from their surface through _radiation pressure_, naturally limiting their mass
- At the bottom: very cool red stars are not hot enough to begin nuclear reactions: the temperature in their core is too low

We can suppose that luminous blue stars have high mass and dim red stars low mass, and that this is the main determining factor of where a star appears on the main sequence. (We will check this theoretically later)

## The main sequence: mass and luminosity

- Later we will see that luminosity is increased with higher mass: $L\propto M^\alpha$.

We can estimate the time a star spends on the main sequence with

\begin{align}
\mathrm{Lifetime} = \frac{\mathrm{energy\ available}}{\mathrm{luminosity}} \propto \frac{M}{M^\alpha}
\end{align}

__The most massive stars spend the least amount of time on the main sequence__

## Giants and Supergiants

Giants and supergiants sit above the main sequence in the top-right

- Large $L$ but low $T$, so $r$ must be very large: 'giants'
- This area is less populated than the main sequence, so stars spend less of their lives in this phase
- We will see that they reach this stage of their life after they spend time on the main sequence
- We need to explain what causes the radius of the star to increase!

# White dwarfs

- White dwarfs sit at the bottom-left of the HR diagram
- Below the main sequence, so radius smaller: 'dwarfs'
- $L\sim 0.01 L_\odot$, none visible to the naked eye
- $T\sim 16000\,$K.
- $R\sim R_\odot /70$ (similar size to the Earth)
- We need to explain why the radius is so small!
- How do they get to be so hot?

We need Stellar Evolution to explain all this!

# Classification schemes

We have seen that on the main sequence, there are a range of star colours. We can use this to classify them.

- Hot stars appear blue, cool stars appear red
- We can quantify this by measuring the flux (magnitude) in different wavelength bands
- The Photometric system divides the spectrum into commonly used bands
- A common convention:
  - Ultraviolet (U-band): centred on 350 nm
  - Blue (B-band): centred on 440 nm
  - Visible (V-band): centred on 550 nm
  - Red (R-band): centred around 600 nm
  - Near-infrared (I-band): around 800 nm

Filters are placed over the telescope to select a band.
Here is an photograph of a set of filters.

![UBVRI filters](img/UBVRI_filters.jpg)

Different instruments have slightly different filters from different manufacturers. Here is an example.

![UBVRI](img/UBVRI.jpeg)

We don't have to memorise this for the course.

![spectrum](img/spectrum_bb.jpeg)

## Colour Index

- The colour index is the numerical difference in magnitudes between measurements made in two wavelength bands
- To measure the index, measurements are made successively through two different filters, such as U and B, or B and V to give the usual colour indices, e.g.
- __B - V__  Difference between magnitude in Blue and Visible bands
- __V - I__  Difference between magnitude in Visible and Near-Infrared bands

Note that the bolometric luminosity is not measured by any of the filters! In practice, care must be taken when doing physics calculations using the total Luminosity to make sure that a correction is applied, which depends on the temperature of the star. For this course we will ignore this, and you can assume that luminosity problems will be set with the bolometric magnitude. But in historical sources the V-band magnitude is used.

## Colour Index Examples

The Sun, which appears yellowish, has
- U band apparent magnitude -25.96
- B band apparent magnitude -26.09
- V band apparent magnitude - 26.74
- So the B-V colour index for the Sun is +0.65

<img style="float: right; max-height: 500px; position:relative;" src="img/Rigel.png">


Rigel which appears bluish has
- B band apparent magnitude 0.09
- V band apparent magnitude 0.12
- So the B-V colour index for Rigel is -0.03

- So the smaller the colour index (i.e lower position on a number scale that ranges from positive, through zero, into negative numbers), the more blue (and hotter) the star
- From the Planck curve you would think that any given star surface temperature T would have automatically determined values of the colour indices
- However real stars are a bit more complicated than ideal black bodies ….

## Colour Index and the HR diagram
- Colour Index was the original quantity plotted along the x-axis in the HR-diagram
- This is why $\log_{10}T$ decreases going from left to right!
- The exact relationship between Colour Index and effective temperature is not simple, but we can state it approximately as :

$$B-V \approx \frac{7000\, \mathrm{K}}{T} - 0.56$$

## Light from the Sun

<img src="img/solarspectrum_noao.jpg" style="float:left; padding: 0.5cm">

__What do we see?__
- Dark absorption lines, superimposed on the expected continuous spectrum
- The lines are fingerprints of the elements present in the Sun's atmosphere

To go further we need to answer one of our first questions:
- What are the stars made of?

- Stars are mainly hydrogen
- Hydrogen emits light only at particular __emission lines__ when excited in the laboratory.
- So why do we see a continuous spectrum?
- Why do we see absorption lines in the spectrum of stars?
- Why do we see emission lines from regions of the sky nears stars? (Emission nebulae)

## Light from the Sun – early observations
- 1802 : Wollaston discovered the dark lines in the Solar spectrum
- 1814 : Fraunhofer catalogued 475 of these lines

They showed that the continuum light from the Sun was absorbed at discrete wavelengths
- 1860 : Kirchhoff and Bunsen published rules for the production of these spectral lines

Gustav Kirchoff studied the three types of spectra seen under different conditions, and, in 1860, derived laws to explain them

![Emission and Absoption spectra](img/EmissionAbsorption.png)

## Kirchoff's Laws

- __1.__ A hot and opaque solid, liquid or highly compressed gas emits a continuous blackbody as-named by Kirchhoff) spectrum with no spectral lines 
- __2.__ A hot, transparent gas, illuminated by a continuum source, produces a spectrum of bright emission lines
- __3.__ If a continuous spectrum passes through a transparent gas at a lower temperature, the cooler gas will absorb at characteristic wavelengths resulting in dark absorption lines

For 2 and 3, the number and colours of the lines depends on the elements present in the gas

- Kirchoff produced these laws without knowing about the energy levels in atoms!

# Spectral type of stars

By 1890 stars were classified in order of the line strength of hydrogen :

        A, B, C, . . . . . . M, N, O, P

- _A_ had the strongest line strength
- _P_ had the weakest line strength

![Balmer Series](img/BalmerSeries.png)
Visible Hydrogen emission lines (Balmer Series)

<img src="img/AnnieCannon.png" style="float: left; max-height: 500px; position:relative; padding: 0.5cm; max-width: 50%">

By the end of the 19th Century it was possible to photograph the spectra of light from many stars.
- Annie Jump Cannon (1863 - 1941) working at the Harvard College Observatory from 1896 examined the spectra of nearly 400,000 stars!
- She found that the spectra of light from stars fell into natural categories based on the strength of certain key line features (principally the Hydrogen lines)
- She created a much more simple classification system based on this, the __Harvard Classification__, which is still in use today
- In this system every star has a letter that describes its colour, known as its _spectral class_.

<img src="img/Gaposchkin.jpg" style="float: left; max-height: 500px; position:relative; padding: 0.5cm;">

- This classification was simpler, but it was not understood what caused the lines.
- In 1925 Cecilia Payne Gaposchkin put the pieces together and showed 
    - that __stars are mainly composed of Hydrogen and Helium__
    - that the spectral class and line behaviour that Cannon observed were related to temperature
    - The Harvard classification was therefore a sequencing of stars from hottest to coolest
    
So while the Colour Index is a straightforward objective measure of colour, it can be more useful to talk about the __spectral class__ (or type) of a star.

## Harvard Spectral Classification

The Harvard Classification Scheme considers the changes in other lines as well as hydrogen
It gives a sequence indicating source temperature:

            O, B, A, F, G, K, M

- ‘O’ stars are hot and blue
- ‘M’ stars are cool and red
- Temperature decreases from left to right
- The odd letter sequence is a rearrangement in temperature order of an older classification scheme
- Under this scheme, the Sun is a G-type star

![Harvard Classification](img/Harvard.png)
<img src="img/BalmerSeries.png" width=47% style="float:left;">

# Harvard spectral classes
- O : Hottest, blue-white stars
   - Few lines, strong He II absorption (sometimes emission) lines
- B : Hot, blue-white stars
   - He I absorption lines strongest at B2, H II (Balmer) absorption lines becoming stronger
- A : White stars
   - Balmer absorption lines strongest at A0, becoming weaker later
- F : Yellow-white stars
   - Ca II lines continue to strengthen as Balmer lines continue to weaken
   - Neutral metal absorption lines (Fe I, Cr I
   

- G : Yellow stars
   - Solar-type spectra
   - Ca II lines continue to strengthen
   - Fe I and other neutral metal lines continue to strengthen
- K : Cool orange stars
   - Ca II, H and K lines strongest at K0, becoming weaker later
   - Spectra dominated by metal absorption lines
- M : Coolest red stars
   - Spectra dominated by molecular absorption bands, especially titanium oxide (TiO)
   - Neutral metal absorption lines remain strong

## Harvard Subclasses
Each type is subdivided into 10 subclasses.
These reflect gradual temperature changes

    	e.g.	A0, A1, A2. . . . . . A7, A8, A9
        
- 0 represents the hotter end of a subclass
- 9 represents the cooler end of a subclass

e.g  O9 is next to B0

Allocation of subtype depends on line strengths and ratios.
- The Sun is a G2-type star.
- Others: Vega A0, Rigel B8, Polaris F8, Betelgeuse M2.

## Morgan-Keenan Luminosity Class

The Harvard classification scheme does not completely describe a star as it cannot distinguish between stars with the same temperature but with different luminosities.

For example it cannot distinguish between main sequence (dwarf) stars, giant stars and supergiant stars
- Think of the different stars that could lie on a vertical (i.e. constant temperature) line towards the right-hand side of the HR diagram.

The Morgan-Keenan luminosity class (MK class) was established to add discrimination on the basis of luminosity
- In its current form, the MK class system ranges from (roman numeral) I to VII
- Class I is subdivided  I-O (hypergiant star), through Ia (bright supergiant) and 1b (dim supergiant) 
- Then there are classes II, III , IV and  V (going from bright giants down to main sequence dwarfs)
- The systems ends with classes VI (sub-dwarf) and VII (white dwarf)

## HR diagram with MK luminosity classes
![HR with MK class](img/HR_MK.png)

- Luminosity classes are determined (mainly) from the observed widths of spectral lines.
- Several effects can cause broadening of the spectral lines we observe
  - Common to the broadening effects is their dependence on star temperature and pressure
  - High pressure and temperature cause atoms to  collide more frequently, broadening their spectral (line) emission the effect is seen particularly in hot, dense stars like White Dwarfs	

## Mass-luminosity relationship

Observations from binary systems (where masses can be determined) indicate a relationship between mass and luminosity
- This is only true for Main Sequence stars
We find:

    $$\frac{L}{L_\odot}\approx \left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)^\alpha$$

The value of $\alpha$ depends on the fit used in the data, but is roughly $3.0 \le \alpha \le 3.5$.

![Mass-Luminosity](img/M-L.png)

## Mass-luminosity and the HR diagram

![ML in the HR](img/HR-ML.png)

- The Mass-Luminosity relationship holds only for Main Sequence stars
- The more massive a star, the more luminous it is
  - A star only 20 times the mass of the Sun would be around 35000 times as luminous as the Sun
- The most massive stars are at the upper left hand part of the HR-diagram
- The least massive stars are at the bottom right
- The Sun, a G2V star, sits around the middle of the Main Sequence

## Explaining the mass-luminosity relationship

- Massive stars have large gravitational compression of their cores because of the large mass of the outer layers
- For equilibrium, massive stars therefore need high radiation pressure pushing outward to balance the large gravitational compression
- The high thermal pressure is provided by high temperature in a massive star’s core – higher than the temperature found in low-mass star

The nuclear reaction rate in a star is very sensitive to the core temperature
even a slight increase in temperature makes the nuclear reactions occur at a MUCH higher rate.
- So a slight increase in the mass of the star produces a large increase in the star’s luminosity

## Mass-Luminosity Relationship – implication

- The luminosity is a very strong function of mass : $3.0\le\alpha\le3.5$  is quite big.
- There are great implications for how long stars live on the Main Sequence
- Massive stars have very short lifetimes because they burn up their fuel more quickly than less massive stars

We will return to this when we study stellar evolution.
