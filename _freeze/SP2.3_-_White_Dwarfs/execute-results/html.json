It is a planetary nebula discovered by William Herschel in 1788. In $\\sim 30,000$ years it will fade leaving a White Dwarf star. Top left: a telescope built by William Herschel.](img/Herschel_40_foot.jpg)\n\n__William Herschel__ started building his own telescopes and lenses, not being satisfied with commercial ones. \nHe built his first large telescope in 1774 and during his career he observed over 5000 nebulae.\nIn 1781 he discovered Uranus, and after that he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Societ and started working as a Court Astronomer for George III.\n\nWilliam Herschel was also the first one to do (rudimentally) astronomical spectrophotometry, using prisms and instruments to measure the temperature of light diffracted at different wavelenghts. One day, while doing this, he noticed that beyond the rainbow diffracted by the prism, where seemingly there was no diffracted light, the temperature was still changing: he discovered the infrared light.\n\n__Caroline Herschel__ got passionate about astronomy while assisting his brother William in his observations and in creating the catalogues.\n_She was actually the first of the Hereschels siblings to discover a nebula, even though she usually does not get enough credit for that!_\n\nAt that time, in 1783, William was focused on the studies of double stars and asked Caroline to scan the sky in search of interesting objects. That is when, on the same night, she discovered both a nebula that was not in the Messier catalogue and the galaxy Messier110 (@fig-messier110), a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy.\n\nCaroline also realised that William's methods of building the catalogue and searching for nebulae (organized by constellation as per Flamsteed's catalogue), were not really efficient and precise. She created her own catalogue, organizing observed astronomical objects by north polar distance.\nOn top of that, she revised the whole Flamsteed's catalogue, which presented some errors, and published a catalogue containing an index of all the observations made by Flamsteed, a list of errata, and a list of over 560 stars that were not included until then. This work was called _Catalogue of Stars, Taken from Mr. Flamsteed's Observations Contained in the Second Volume of the Historia Coelestis, and Not Inserted in the British Catalogue_.\nShe published more astronomical catalogues during her career, and two of them are still in use today.\n\nCaroline was also the first woman to discover a comet. She discovered eight comets during her career, and her work was internationally recognised.\n\nShe was the first female professional astronomer in England and the first woman to:\n\n- be paid as a scientist\n- hold a government position in England\n- publish scientific findings in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\n- be awarded a Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1828)\n- be named an Honorary Member of the Royal Astronomical Society (1835, with Mary Somerville).\n\nOn her 96th birthday (1846), the King of Prussia presented her with a Gold Medal for Science for her contributions to science.\n\n![Caroline and William Herschel.](img/herschels.jpeg){#fig-herschels}\n\n![Messier110 (NGC 205), discovered by Caroline Herschel, is a dwarf galaxy, second companion of the Andromeda galaxy.](img/messier110.jpeg){#fig-messier110}\n\n# Modeling white dwarfs\n\nWe have seen that the central pressure in a star is given by (@eq-central-pressure)\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n  P_{\\text{c}}=\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)^{1/3}GM^{2/3}\\rho^{4/3},\n\\end{equation}\n$${#eq-central-pressure2}\nand in a stellar remnant where both electrons and protons are _non-relativistic_, the dominant degeneracy pressure is due to electrons,\ngiven by (@eq-quantum-pressures)\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n{P_{\\text{Qe}}=\\frac{\\beta}{2} \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{m_{\\text{e}}}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_{\\text{p}}}\\right)^{5/3}}\n\\end{equation}\n$${#eq-quantum-pressure-elec}\nwhere $\\beta$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity.\n\n(For the idealised case used for the derivation in Chapter 8,  we assumed $\\beta = 2$, then we added this factor at the end).\n\n__A stellar remnant where the self-gravity is balanced by electron\ndegeneracy pressure is called a white dwarf__.\n\n## White dwarf density\n\nIn Chapter 8 we found the average density of a white dwarf from its mass and volume, let's now see how the density is related to the mass.\n\nEquating $P_{\\text{Qe}}$ and $P_{\\text{c}}$, we have (solving for the density of the white dwarf $\\rho=\\rho_{WD}$)\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{m_{\\text{e}}}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_{\\text{p}}}\\right)^{5/3}&=\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)^{1/3}GM^{2/3}\\rho^{4/3}\\\\\n      \\rho^{1/3}&=\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)^{1/3}GM^{2/3}\\frac{2}{\\beta}\\frac{m_{\\text{e}}}{\\hbar^{2}}m_{\\text{p}}^{5/3}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{WD}}=\\frac{4\\pi}{3\\beta^{3}}G^{3}\\frac{m_{\\text{e}}^{3}m_{\\text{p}}^{5}}{\\hbar^{6}}M^{2}\n$${#eq-wd-density}\n\n- Hence the density of a white dwarf depends on the __square of its mass__.\n- Calculating out the constants, we find that the density of a white dwarf $\\rho_{\\text{WD}}$ is about $10^{7}$ times greater than the density of water, i.e. $\\rho_{\\text{WD}}\\approx 10^{10}\\,\\text{kg m}^{-3}$.\n- So 1 cm$^{3}$ of white dwarf material weighs about 10 tons!\n\n## White dwarf radius\n\nWhat is the radius of a white dwarf star? \nIn Chapter 8 we said that this is roughly the radius of the Earth, but we did not justify this assumption.

This now includes also relativistic quantum degeneracy pressure (@eq-relativistic-degen-pressure).](img/logrhologP2.jpg){#fig-log-pressure-relativistic}\n\nWhen the electrons become relativistic (beyond the Chandrasekar mass limit), the slope of the degeneracy pressure curve changes from $5/3$ to $4/3$.\n\nAbove the Chandrasekhar mass, the curves for the central pressure due to self-gravity, $P_{\\text{c}}$, and the relativistic electron degeneracy pressure, $P_{\\text{QeR}}$, are __parallel__. Therefore,\nthese curves will no longer intersect.\n\nSo above $M_{\\text{Ch}}$, there is no value of $R$ for which $P_{\\text{QeR}}$ balances $P_{\\text{c}}$. No equilibrium is possible, and so the stellar\nremnant will continue to contract under its own gravity. \n\nIt will continue to shrink past the conditions for a white dwarf until some pressure source _other_ than electron degeneracy pressure can counteract the self-gravity.\n\n- This pressure source is _neutron degeneracy pressure_.\n- It too is overcome above the _Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit_ - see Chapter 10.\n\n# Observational Properties of White Dwarfs\n\n## Do white dwarfs actually exist?\n\n- Yes, we can see them.\n\n![White dwarf stars observed in M4.](img/WDM4.jpg){#fig-wd-observed}\n\n- Although very faint, they can be observed directly with a telescope\n- We can use our knowledge from SP1 (Chapters 1 to 6) to infer the physical properties in the same way we did for main sequence stars.\n\nMeasuring the amount of light we receive from a white dwarf gives us its apparent magnitude, $m$. If we can determine the distance, $d$, to the star (by parallax etc), we can then work out its absolute magnitude, $M$, using the distance modulus formula (@eq-apparent-absolute-magnitude):\n \n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n   M=m+5-5\\log_{10}d.\n\\end{equation}\n$${#eq-apparent-absolute-magnitude2}\n      \nThe absolute magnitude then gives us the star's luminosity, $L$, from Pogson's equation (@eq-absolute-magnitude):\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n   M-M_{\\odot}=-2.5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L}{L_{\\odot}}\\right)\n\\end{equation}\n$${#eq-absolute-magn-pogson}\n\n- If we examine the spectrum of the light we receive from the star (and assume it emits like a blackbody), we can determine the temperature of the white dwarf using Wien's Displacement Law (@eq-wien-displacement-law):\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}}T=b\\hspace{1cm}b=2.898\\times 10^{- 3}\\,\\text{m K}.\n\\end{equation}\n$${#eq-wiens-displacement2}\n\n- If we have $L$ and $T$, we can then obtain the radius of the star, $R$, using the Stefan-Boltzmann law (@eq-total-luminosity):\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\nL=4\\pi R^{2}\\sigma T^{4}.\n\\end{equation}\n$${#eq-luminosity-stefan2}\n\n- If the star is in a binary system, we can also work out its mass from observations of its orbital motion.\n- We can then determine the mean stellar density, and whether the white dwarf stars we observe follow our derived $R \\propto M^{-1/3}$ relation.\n\n\n## What do the observations tell us?\n\n### Example: Sirius B\n\n![Sirius B, the white dwarf companion of Sirius A.](img/SiriusB.jpg){#fig-siriusb2}\n\nTake as an example the most famous white dwarf, __Sirius B__ (@fig-siriusb2), the binary companion of Sirius A.\n\n| Observed Properties | value | note |\n|---------------------|-------|------|\n| m | 8.44 | apparent magnitude |\n| d | 2.64 pc | distance (via parallax) |\n| T | 25200 K | Temperature (via Wien's law) |\n\n- The orbital period is 50.09 years, and system is a visual binary, so orbital parameters can be observed directly: orbital separation ranges between $8$--$32$ AU; ratio of the distances of each star from the\ncentre-of-mass $r_{1}/r_{2} = 0.466$.\n- Binary observations give a mass $0.98 M_{\\odot} = 1.95\\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{kg}$.\n- It was realised in 1915 that this is a hot blue-white star.  Initially this was thought to be \"absurd\". \n\n### <span style=\"color:#336699;\">Exercise</span>\n\nCalculate the absolute magnitude $M$, luminosity $L$, radius $R$ and density $\\rho$ of Sirius B, using the information and values listed above.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\nUsing these values and the equations listed in the previous paragraph, we can find:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n        M&=11.18\\nonumber\\\\\n        L&=0.023L_{\\odot}\\nonumber\\\\\n        R&=0.008R_{\\odot}=5.7\\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{m}\\nonumber\\\\\n        \\rho&=2.5\\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n- Hence Sirius B is about the size ($\\sim 10^{6}$ m), density ($\\sim 10^{9}\\mathrm{kg\\, m}^{-3}$), and temperature ($>10,000$ K) we expect for a white dwarf.\n\n</details>\n\n## Another example: 40 Eridani B\n\n![Radius vs mass plot showing the lines where the white dwarfs lie, and highlighting 40 Eridani B and Sirius B.](img/WDMassRadius.jpg){#fig-wd-mass-radius}\n\nThe first white dwarf to be observed, by William Herschel in 1783, was 40 Eridani B.\n\nThese are its properties:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n        L&=0.013L_{\\odot},\\hspace{0.2cm}R=0.014R_{\\odot}\\nonumber\\\\\n        M&=0.5M_{\\odot},\\hspace{0.2cm}T=16,500\\,\\text{K}\\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-erib-properties}\n\nLet us compare this with the observational properties of Sirius B.\n\n- Taking mass and radius ratios with Sirius B, we find\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}=\\left(\\frac{M_{1}}{M_{2}}\\right)^{-0.61}\n\\end{equation}\n$${#eq-radius-erib-siriusb}\n\n- Theoretically, the index should be $-1/3=-0.33$, so the agreement is not too bad (and the sign is correct!). Observations of other white dwarfs broadly confirm the relationship (but with large uncertainties).\n\n# Accretion\n\nStellar remnants in close binary systems may gravitationally attract material away from their companion stars. This material flows onto the surface of the remnant in a process called _accretion_.\n\n![Roche lobes showing the areas where material is gravitationally attracted to the stars and can flow from one star to the other at the Lagrangian point.](img/detached.jpg){#fig-roche-lobes1}\n\nConsider the gravitational potential in a binary\nsystem.

This thermonuclear explosion temporarily sweeps away the accretion disc: when it builds up again sufficiently, another nova occurs.\n    \n\n## Supernovae\n\n![SN 1572 - Tycho's supernova.](img/tycho.jpg)|{#fig-tycho-sn}\n\n- If the mass of an accreting carbon white dwarf approaches $M_{\\text{Ch}}$, the density within the star becomes sufficiently high that rapid carbon fusion can begin throughout the entire star - a _carbon detonation supernova_ (Type 1a). \n- This is probably sufficiently violent that it disrupts the entire star, gravitationally unbinding it and blowing it apart: a stable neutron star probably never gets a chance to form.\n\n",
