Is the Death Star a (fictional) star?\n\n<details>\n<summary> Answer </summary>\nThe answer is \"no\", because it does not radiate energy! The Death Star is actually a (fictional) space station orbiting the (fictional) planet moon of Endor.\nEnough with the fictional stuff now.\n</details>\n\n2. If you look at the sky you may see that planets and comets are also shining in the sky, so why can't they be considered stars, based on the definition given above? Do they radiate energy? Are they self-gravitating?\n\n<details>\n<summary> Answer </summary>\nPlanets actually do not _radiate_, they mostly reflect the light coming from the Sun, and the same holds for comets. In addition to that, comets do not have enough mass to be considered self-gravitating objects.\n</details>\n\n\n## Life and death of a star\nA star is not a static object. During its life it will evolve, changing its internal structure and chemical composition as it 'burns its _fuel_' and changing its mass and size.\n\nThe death of a star eventually occurs when one of the conditions that define a star is no longer valid, i.e. when the star is no longer self-gravitating, or when it stops radiating having exhausted its nuclear fuel.\n\nWe will talk more about the evolution of stars in the following lectures.\nNow let's go back to what we can observe having a look at the night sky and let's see what we can tell from observations of stars.\n\n## Do all stars look the same?\n<img src=\"img/intro2.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"/>\n\n![Examples of stars](img/M3_color3.gif)\n\n- There are a lot of stars, not uniformly distributed\n- Some look brighter than others\n- Some are bigger than others\n- They have different colours\n- Sometimes there are coloured or dark areas around stars\n- Some stars have fluctuating brightness: repeating and irregular\n\n## A comparison between two stars on Stellarium\n\nLet's check the properties of two stars on Stellarium. What can you notice after a first look at these stars in  @fig-Stellarium-stars-compare?\nYou may notice that they have different colours (one looks white, the other one looks white-blue). The boxes contain some information about these stars, and you may recognise many of these fields in the blue boxes from positional astronomy. We will find out what the properties in the red boxes mean during this course.\n\n![Comparison between two stars on Stellarium](img/Stellarium_stars_p.png){#fig-Stellarium-stars-compare}\n\n## What can we tell from observations?\n\n- How distant are the stars?\n- How big are they?\n- How bright?\n- How, when and where do they form?\n- What are their most important characteristics?\n- What are they made of?\n- What is their energy source?\n- What happens when it runs out?\n\n# How distant are the stars?\n\n## An easy case: the distance to the Sun\n\n__How do we find the distance to the Sun?__\n\nEasy! - Just define The Astronomical Unit (a.u.) as the average distance between the Earth and the Sun!\n\n## The astronomical unit\n\nOk, but how big is an au?\nIn 1976 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a standard definition whose value has been updated with increasing precision  during the years.

One way to determine the distance to nearest stars is to use the _parallax method_.\n\nIf you look at the position of a closer object against a further background, you will notice that the image of the near object will shift in the background as you move (see @fig-parallax1). This effect is called parallax and you can experience it even when you close one eye at the time looking at an object against a background.\n\n<!-- <div>\n<img src=\"img/Parallax_Example.png\" width=\"700\"/>\n</div> -->\n![Illustrative example of the parallax method. The background against which the yellow star object is seen changes based on the viewpoint.](img/Parallax_Example.png){#fig-parallax1}\n\nAnalogously, in a background of distant stars, a closer star will appear to move against them as the Earth orbits the Sun. So how do we use this to determine the distance to a start? We use trigonometry.\n\nThe angle formed between the lines of sight of a star from two positions of the observer is twice the parallax angle.\n@fig-parallax2 shows the parallax as the angle between the lines of sight of the observer on Earth and from the Sun (the middle point between the position of Earth six months apart).\n\nThe number of stars that can be observed from Earth is limited and nowadays _direct_ observations of the distance using the parallax method are done by satellites orbiting the Sun in sync with Earth. Hipparcos gathered data on more than one million stars, and its successor Gaia has already observed 2 billion stars!\n\n<!-- <img src=\"img/parallax_parsecs.webp\" style=\"max-height: 600px; display: block; position:relative; float:right; padding-left:.5cm\"> -->\n\n![Parallax and parsecs representation.

Gregory is seldom given any credits for this idea and usually all the credits goes to Edmund Halley for some reason (can anyone find out why?).\n\nIn 1677, at the age of 20, Halley travelled to St Helena to map the Southern Skies and observed a transit of Mercury on November 7th.\nLike Gregory, he suggested that the transit of a planet like Venus could be used as a method to measure the distance to the Sun, using parallax.\n\n[Here](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/transit/HalleyParallax.html) is the translation of Halley's publication about this idea.\n\n![A composite image of the June 2004 transit of Venus as seen from Waldenburg, Germany.

Each observer would precisely measure the times that Venus appear to be in different positions (contact points) relative to the Sun. The observers would see different chords of the planet's trajectory across the disk of the sun due to parallax. \nVenus forms two similar triangles with the Earth and the Sun at their opposite edges. Since the triangles are similar, the projected distance on the Sun can be found by comparing it to a known baseline on Earth. Once the angle shift is measured, the distances to Venus and then to the Sun can be determined using trigonometry.\n\nModern techniques use radar echo ranging to measure distances in the Solar System very precisely.\n\n<!-- Venus forms two similar triangles with the Earth and the Sun at their opposite edges.

Extend your arm, place the hand at a right angle and follow the intstructions of @fig-handy-guide to estimate different angles.\nThis may not be useful to determine the size of objects that are very far and appear too small, such as stars, but can be useful to measure the angular distance between two stars.\n\n![How to use hands to measure angular distances in the sky](img/measuring-sky-with-hand.png){#fig-handy-guide}\n\n## How far apart are the stars?\n\nLet's have a look at some orders of magnitude (this is a good resource if you want to visualise them: https://scaleofuniverse.com/en-gb).\n\n- The nearest star (Proxima Centauri) is about $10^{16}$ m away.\n- Diameter of the Sun ~ $10^{9}$ m.\n- The difference in scale is $10^7$m in distance, or $10^{21}$m$^3$ in volume.\n- Relative to their size, stars are the most isolated structures in the universe.\n- If stars were grains of sand (~1 mm), they would be ~10 km apart!\n- However, we find them in clusters and binaries - what explains this? (more on this later)\n\n# How bright are stars?\n\nIf we try to answer this question based on our observations, we have to keep in mind that the apparent brightness of a light source will vary depending on its distance from the observer. The brightenss we observe is therefore not an _intrinsic_ property of the stars, as it depends on the distance between the observer and the stars.\n\nThis is the reason why we need to differentiate between the _apparent brightness_ of a star and its _luminosity_.\n\n## Apparent brightness and luminosity\n\nThe __apparent brightness__, $F$, also referred to as the _radiant flux_ or _power flux_, is the total amount of energy emitted by a star, per unit time, crossing an unit area (units [$\\mathrm{W/m}^2$]).\nIt is _not_ an intrinsic property of a star, because it depends on the distance from the star.\n \n@fig-inverse-square-law can give you a better understanding of that. Each square represents an unit area. The lightbulb, like a star, radiates equally in every direction (i.e. isotropically). The 'rays' coming out of the light source represent the flux. The farther the position of the observer is from the source, the less flux the observer, in one unit area, will receive. The relationship between the power flux, $F$, and the distance to the source, $r$, is given by the inverse square law: $$F\\propto \\dfrac{1}{r^2}.$$\nSince the light source radiates isotropically (even though the figure below shows only a portion of the rays), the power flux $F$ is equal across all parts of the sphere at a given distance.\n\n![Inverse square law of the radiant flux of a light source](img/inverse_square_law.png){#fig-inverse-square-law}\n\nThe __Luminosity__ of a star, $L$, measured in Watts (W) or equivalently Joules per second (J/s), is its energy output per unit time. The luminosity is the _total_ energy radiated in all the directions in an unit time and it does not depend on the distance from the observer: it is an _intrinsic_ property of the star.\n\nHow are these two quantities related?\n\nImagine a sphere of radius $r$ centered on a star, which is isotropically radiating. We saw that the luminosity (energy output per unit time) does not depend upon the distance, but the radiant flux $F$ does. To find the power flux $F$, we need to divide the luminosity equally over the area of the sphere, $4\\pi r^2$. Therefore\n$$\nF = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2}\n$${#eq-flux}\n\nThe apparent brightness depends on the luminosity and on the distance of the observer from the star. From @eq-flux, you can see how two stars of equal luminosity, located at different distances from Earth, would have different apparent brightness.\n\n_Photometry_ is the measurement of the quantity of light from a star, i.e. the flux of energy per unit time, per unit area, that we receive at Earth.\n\nFor a particular star, if we know the luminosity ($L$) of the star and its distance from Earth ($r$), we can calculate the radiant flux using @eq-flux.\n\n### The Sun's luminosity\n\nFor our Sun, we have:\n\n$F_\\odot = 1361\\,  \\mathrm{W/m^2}$ (The \"Solar Constant\", or \"Solar irradiance\", sometimes indicated with the symbol $S_\\odot$ in textbooks), and\n\n$r = 1\\, \\mathrm{a.u.} \\approx 1.5\\times 10^{11}\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nTherefore, using @eq-flux:\n\n$L_\\odot = 4\\pi r^2 F = 3.8275 \\times 10^{26}\\, \\mathrm{W}$\n\n::: {.cell slideshow='{\"slide_type\":\"skip\"}' execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy.constants import pi, au, parsec\n\nF = 1361.0 # W/m/m\nr = au # m\nL = F*4*pi*r**2\n\nprint(f'Power flux: F = {F} W/m/m')\nprint(f'r = 1au = {r:1.4e} m')\nprint(f'Luminosity: L =  F*4*pi*r**2 = {L:1.4e} W')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nPower flux: F = 1361.0 W/m/m\nr = 1au = 1.4960e+11 m\nLuminosity: L =  F*4*pi*r**2 = 3.8275e+26 W\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor other stars there is a large range of luminosities:\n\n$10^{-4}\\,L_\\odot < L < 10^{6}\\,L_\\odot$\n\nIf we think of the least luminous star as a 100W incandescent lightbulb, this huge range tells us that the most luminous star would be like the entire worldâs power output.\n\nWhy is there this very large range?

Writing the units of each side of the equation, we see that:\n$[W/m^2]=\\dfrac{[W]}{[m^2]}$, which as expected satisfies the identity, meaning that the formula is dimensionally correct.\n\n## Stellar magnitude scales\n\nThe flux from even nearby stars is tiny, but many bright stars are distinguished by the naked eye. The human eye (like hearing) responds logarithmically to stimulus. When comparing the flux densities of three stars in a 1:10:100 ratio, the perceived brightness gap between the first and second star appears to be the same as the difference between the second and third star. This equality in perceived brightness gaps illustrates that human perception of brightness operates on a logarithmic scale. Therefore, before modern photometry, astronomers had a scale based on their own naked-eye observations: __stellar (apparent) magnitude__.\n\n### Apparent magnitude\n\nThis system to measure the stars brightness was first introduced by the Greek astronomer Hipparchos, who compiled a catalog of 850 stars with their positions and their _apparent magnitudes_ on a scale from $m=1$, being the brightest stars, to $m=6$, being the faintest stars.\nThe apparent magnitude depends on the position of the observer the same way as the flux does (in fact, we will see in the following how these two quantities are related).\n\nThe image below shows an example of a star catalog created by ancient Greek astronomers.\n\n![_Almagest_ Ptolemy, c. 150AD image credit: BibliothÃ¨que Nationale, Paris](img/Almagest.png){#fig-Almagest}\n\nThe English translation reads\n\n![Almagest translated](img/AlmagestTranslation.png){#fig-Almagest-translated}\n\nWe can still recognise the constellations and find these stars today!\n\n![<small>Ursa Minor constellation and magnitude scale.

For instance, the human eye can observe in the visible part of the spectrum, but not in the IR or UV. Likewise, telescopes can have filters to observe different parts of the spectrum.\nMagnitude can therefore be specified for different wavelength intervals, i.e. observed with different coloured filters on the telescope.\n\n- For stars, the most commonly quoted magnitude is the **visual magnitude**, the magnitude in the visual part of the spectrum.\n- Another commonly used magnitude is the **bolometric magnitude**, which include the luminosity across the whole electromagnetic spectrum of wavelengths, whether observed or not. We will use this when performing some physics calculations.\n- One of the most common magnitude systems used in photometry is the **UBV system**, where magnitudes are measured through ultraviolet (U), blue (B) and visual (V) filters.\n\nThe magnitudes we mentioned so far, e.g. $M_\\odot = 4.74$, are __bolometric magnitudes__.\n\nThe visual magnitude $V$ and the bolometric magnitude $M_{bol}$ (or just $M$) are related by the _bolometric correction_ BC through the formula\n\n$$\nM_{bol} - V = BC,\n$${#eq-bolometric-correction}\n\nwhere $BC<0$.\n\nIn a multicolour system, such as UBV, it is useful to introduce the __colour index__. This is the difference between two magnitudes of that system.\nConsidering the UBV system, for instance:\n\n- the $U-B$ color index of a star is the difference between its ultraviolet and blue magnitudes ($U-B=M_U-M_B$)\n- the $B-V$ color index of a star is the difference between its blue and visual magnitudes ($V-B=M_V-M_B$).\n\nWe will come back to this again in the next chapter.\n\n# Recap\n\n- The distance to near stars can be determined using the parallax method\n- 1 parsec is the distance to a star having a parallax angle of 1 arcsec\n\n- The apparent brightness of a star scales with the inverse square of the distance to the star\n- The luminosity of a star is the total energy emitted per unit time \n\n- The magnitude scale is logarithmic\n- Apparent magnitude is a measure of brightness dependent on the distance to the observer\n- Absolute magnitude is a measure of brightness intrinsic to the star\n\n- We can find the luminosity in S.I. units from the absolute magnitude\n- We can convert apparent to absolute magnitude if we know the distance to the star in parsecs\n\n# Stellar Colour\n\n## Why are the stars different colours?\n![Stars of different colours](img/intro2.png)\n\nWe anticipated that stars have different colours in the first section of this chapter (see @fig-Stellarium-stars-compare), where we introduced the observed properties of stars.\n\nWhy are stars different colours?\n\nWe know that light is an electromagnetic wave, and that the colour we perceive depends on the wavelength of the light.\n\n![Linear representation of the visible light spectrum. Credits: [Wikimedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Linear_visible_spectrum.svg)](img/Linear_visible_spectrum.png){#fig-visible-spectrum}\n\n- Red light has a wavelength $\\approx 650$ nm\n- Blue light has a wavelength $\\approx 450$ nm\n- White light is a mixture of all visible wavelengths\n\nThe reason why stars appear to have different colours is that they do not emit the same amount of radiation at all wavelengths: some star emit more toward the red end of the spectrum, others toward the blue end, as well as beyond the visible window, such as emission in the infrared or ultraviolet.\n\nTo understand what regulates the emission of stars at the different wavelengths, determining the colours that we observe, we need to introduce the concept of _black-body_.\n\n\n## Black body radiation\n\n- A body that totally absorbs all radiation that falls upon it is called a __black-body__. You can think of it as a perfect absorber of radiation.\n- A black body is in thermal equilibrium, so it has a temperature $T$.\n- If it absorbs energy then it must also re-radiate it to stay in thermal equilibrium.\n- A black body is a perfect absorber but it is also a perfect emitter.\n\nWe anticipated that stars radiate different amounts of energy at different wavelengths. Let us assume that we can consider stars as black bodies.\n\nWhat is the distribution of radiation across wavelengths (or frequencies) that a black body emits?\n\n<!-- Earlier in this chapter we defined the _radiant flux_ (@eq-flux) as the energy received per second, per unit area. -->\n\nWe want to know the power emitted per unit wavelength $\\lambda$, per unit area, per unit solid angle (steradian): the __spectral radiance__ $B_\\lambda(\\lambda;T)$.\n\nFor a perfect emitter, radiation is emitted:\n\n- _equally_ from the surface of an object\n- _isotropically_ over solid angle.\n\n_The emission spectra of black bodies (the energy emitted against the wavelength or frequency) depend only on their temperature $T$._\n\nSo what is the form of the emission spectrum of a black body?\nAlthough the spectrum of black-body radiation was known observationally, its theoretical description has puzzled physicists at the end of the 19th Century and many attempts to describe this ran into trouble. It cannot be fully explained using classical physics, it requires quantum physics, as we will see in the following.\n\n### Rayleigh-Jeans law\n\nLord Rayleigh used classical physics to predict the shape of the black body spectrum, which was later refined by Sir James Jeans.\n\nThe Rayleigh-Jeans law is a good approximation to the observed spectrum at long wavelength (low frequencies) $hc\\ll k_BT\\lambda$.\n\n$$\nB_\\lambda^\\mathrm{RJ}(\\lambda; T) = \\frac{2ck_B T}{\\lambda^4}\n$${#eq-rayleigh-jeans-law}\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n![Lord Rayleigh (1842 - 1918)](img/strutt.jpeg)\n\n![Sir James Jeans (1877 - 1946)](img/James_Hopwood_Jeans.jpg){height=80%}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell slideshow='{\"slide_type\":\"skip\"}' execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport numpy as np\nfrom astropy.constants import k_B, c, h\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import rc\nrc('text',usetex=True)\nrc('font',size=15)\nrc('figure',figsize=(8,6), dpi=300)\n\nl = np.linspace(0,3000,1000) # Wavelength, nm\nT = 4000 # Temperature, Kelvin\n\nB_rj=c.value* 2*k_B.value * T /(l*1e-9)**4; # 1e-9 to convert from nm to meters\n\nplt.plot(l, B_rj, label=\"Rayleigh-Jeans law\")\nplt.xlabel(r'Wavelength $\\lambda$ (nm)')\nplt.ylabel(r'Spectral Radiance $B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T=4000K)$ (Wm$^{-3}$sr$^{-1}$)')\nplt.title('Spectral radiance')\nplt.ylim([0,1e15])\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend();\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Spectral radiance plotted using the Rayleigh-Jeans law (@eq-rayleigh-jeans-law).](SP1.1_-_Stellar_Properties_files/figure-html/fig-rayleigh-jeans-plot-output-1.png){#fig-rayleigh-jeans-plot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe Rayleigh-Jeans law has a big problem - the radiance keeps increasing indefinitely at short wavelengths (higher frequencies).
