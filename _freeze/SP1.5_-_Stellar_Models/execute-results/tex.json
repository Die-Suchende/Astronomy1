Why and how do they form?\n- ? What is their energy source?\n- ? What happens when it runs out?\n\nTo make progress with the last three questions we will need to develop better models of the physics going on *inside* a star. This is difficult as we do not have direct access to the interior, but we can use physical models to find out!\n\n## Stellar lifetime\n\nWe have seen from the HR diagram that most stars lie on the main sequence, but that there are giants and dwarfs. We account for this by proposing that stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence and less time in the other states.\n\n#### How old is the Sun?\n\nWe know from radioisotope dating tha the Solar System has existed for about 4.6 billion years. Life on Earth has existed for about 4 billion years, indicating the presence of liquid water (and therefore a hot Sun).\n\n## Solar energy requirements\n\nWe know the mass of the Sun $M_\\odot \\approx 2\\times 10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nWe know it radiates with luminosity $L_\\odot \\approx 4\\times 10^{26}\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n\nThe age of the solar system $\\tau_\\odot \\approx 4.6\\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{years} \\approx 1.5\\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nWe can work out how much energy is required to keep the Sun shining $E\\approx \\tau_\\odot L_\\odot$.\n\n## Efficiency\n\nWe can define the efficiency of the Sun's energy source in Joules / kg:\n\n$\\epsilon = \\frac{E}{M_\\odot} \\ge \\frac{\\tau_\\odot L_\\odot}{M_\\odot}$\n\n$\\epsilon \\ge 3\\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}$\n\n__We need to find a source for all this energy__\n\n## Chemical energy?\nChemical reactions involve rearrangements of electrons in atoms and molecules.\n\n- We have seen the natural units for these processes are electron-volts: $1.6\\times 10^{-19}$ J\n- Compare this to the mass per atom $\\approx m_p = 1.7\\times 10^{-27}$ kg\n\nTherefore the efficiency of chemical reactions is $\\epsilon \\approx \\frac{1.6\\times10^{-19}}{1.7\\times 10^{-27}} \\approx 1\\times 10^8 $J/kg.\n\n* If chemical reactions were the source of the Sun's power it would last only $\\approx \\frac{M_\\odot \\epsilon}{L_\\odot} = 15\\,000\\,\\mathrm{years}$.\n\nThis is >100000 times too short!\n- The Sun is not powered by chemical reactions\n\n## Gravitational Energy?\n\nGravitational potential energy for a proton coming from $\\infty$ to a radius $R$\n\n$$E=\\frac{GMm_p}{R}$$\n\nSo the efficiency is $\\epsilon \\approx \\frac{GM}{R} \\approx 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{J/kg}$. This is greater than the chemical energy.\n\nEstimate lifetime the same way $\\frac{M_\\odot \\epsilon}{L_\\odot} \\approx 1.6\\times10^{7}\\mathrm{years}$.\n\nThis is about 100 times too small - the Sun is not powered by ongoing gravitational collapse.\n- But this is a large amount of energy, we will see later how important it is.\n\n### Lord Kelvin\n\nKelvin performed this calculation himself. The timescale is called the __Kelvin-Helmholtz Timescale__.\n\n__On the Age of the Sun’s Heat__\nBy Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)\nMacmillan's Magazine, vol. 5 (March 5, 1862), pp. 388-393\n\n“As for the future, we may say, with equal certainty, that inhabitants of the earth can not continue to enjoy the light and heat essential to their life for many million years longer _unless sources now unknown to us are prepared in the great storehouse of creation._”\n\nSensibly he hedged his bets in the final sentence!\n\nKelvin did not know about the theory of relativity, $E=mc^2$ and atomic nucleii. Let us look to these for the power we need.\n\n### Relativistic energy\n\nEinstein discovered the relationship between mass and energy, the famous $E=mc^2$.\n\nFor the total conversion of mass to energy we have $\\epsilon = \\frac{mc^2}{m} = c^2 = 9\\times 10^{16}$ J/kg.\n\nIf total conversion was the energy source, we would have $\\tau_\\odot = \\frac{M_\\odot c^2}{L_\\odot} = 3\\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{years}$!\n\nThis is easily long enough to keep the Sun bright.\n\nHowever, this complete conversion requires an equal amount of matter and antimatter.\n\n- We do not see the signature gamma rays from matter annihilation\n- If half the Sun were anti-matter what would prevent explosive annihilation?\n\n- The Sun is not powered by matter annihilation\n\n## Nuclear Fusion\n\nWe need a way to turn mass into energy in a controlled way:\n- Under conditions of very high temperature and very high density, several light nuclei can fuse to form a single nucleus\n- The newly formed nucleus has a slightly lower mass than the combination of the separate nuclei\n- This mass deficit $\\Delta m$ is released as fusion energy $\\Delta E = \\Delta m c^2$.\n\n## Nuclear fusion in the Sun\n\n<img class=\"right_panel\" width=\"500px\" src=\"img/H-He.png\">\n\n* In the Sun, four Hydrogen nucleii (protons) fuse together to form a Helium-4 nucleus (alpha particle).\n* Energy is released in the form of radiation (gamma-rays) and neutrinos.\n\n### Energy budget\n\nTo calculate $\\Delta E = \\Delta m c^2$ we need the mass of a Helium nucleus $m_\\alpha$ and the mass of the proton $m_p$.\n\n- $m_p = 1.673\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $4 m_p = 6.690\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $m_\\alpha = 6.644\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n\nSo $\\Delta m = 4m_p - m_\\alpha = 0.046 \\times 10^{-27}\\,$kg.\n\nAnd $\\Delta E = \\Delta m c^2 = 4.127 \\times 10^{-12}\\,$J. This is the energy available in one H-He fusion reaction.\n\nSo $$\\epsilon_\\mathrm{Fusion} =\\frac{\\Delta E}{m_p} = 2.47\\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}$$\nand the lifetime would be\n$$\\tau = \\frac{M_\\odot \\epsilon_\\mathrm{Fusion}}{L_\\odot} = 4\\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{years}$$\n\nThis is around 100 times the age of the Sun - plausible?\n- Yes, if we do not assume that all of the Sun's mass undergoes fusion.\n\n# Stellar Formation\n\nWe have verified the general picture of stars as fusion-powered for most of their lifetimes. But let's back-track and look again at that energy from gravitational collapse, because we had asked the question\n- Why and how do stars form?\n\nWe know that stars have a finite lifetime, so they must have been born at some point in the past.\nFor the Sun this was about 4.6 billion years ago. __Gravity__ is the key player.\n\nWhat did it form from?\n - Interstellar gas cloud\n\nThe galaxy is full of Hydrogen and Helium produced in the big bang, and dust and gas left over from previous generations of stars (Population II).\n\n- If it is not completely uniform then gravity will cause clumps to collapse.\n\n- As it collapses, the gas heats up (gravitational potential energy is converted to heat energy)\n\n| Object | Number density (particles / $m^3$) |\n|--------|------------------------------------|\n| Earth's atmosphere | $2.5\\times 10^{25}$ |\n| Laboratory vacuum | $1\\times 10^{16}$ |\n| 'Dense' Interstellar cloud | $1\\times 10^{14}$ |\n| 'Average' Interstellar Cloud | $1\\times 10^{13}$ |\n\nThe density is very low, so we need a lot of mass ($>100 M_\\odot$) to collapse under gravity.\n\n- If the cloud is initially rotating even slightly, the rotation speed increases as material collapses inward\n- Spinning material flattens into a __protoplanetary disc__\n\n- The dense central part forms a protostar\n- Surrounding material continues to accrete onto the protostar\n- The temperature rises, and the gas becomes ionised\n- Eventually, if enough material is accreted, the temperature becomes high enough to initiate nuclear fusion - a star is born!\n- Radiation from the hot star pushes material out until equilibrium is reached.\n\n![](img/cluster1mre.avi.mp4)\n\n![Eagle Nebula](img/EagleNebula.jpg)\n\nThe Eagle Nebula showing recently formed stars\n\n![How star are formed](img/HowStarsAreFormed.jpg)\n\n#### Protoplantery disc around nearby star Formalhaut\n\n![Formalhaut's protoplanetary disc](img/Formalhaut.jpg)\n\n# Protostars\n\nLet's model this cloud collapse in a bit more detail.\n\nWe see that initial non-uniformities are amplified by gravity and the cloud fragments as it collapses.\n- Each fragment produces a proto-star\n\nThe temperature of the proto-star increases as gravitational potential energy is converted to heat.\n- Initially, the temperature is 10s of kelvin\n\n$$\\lambda_{peak} = 0.0029 / T_\\mathrm{eff} \\approx 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n\n- This radiation is far-infrared, and too long-wavelength to be absorbed by absorption lines in the gas\n- The cloud is very diffuse\n- Radiation prevents the temperature from increasing very rapidly\n\nRemember Stefan-Boltzmann Law\n$$ L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$$\n\nAt first $T$ is low, but $R$ is very large (hundreds of a.u.).\n\n- As the cloud collapses, the temperature rises slowly to begin with\n- But luminosity is decreasing as $R$ gets smaller\n- The temperature eventually begins to rise in the core of the cloud\n\n# Gravitational Collapse - Energy budget\n\nHow much energy will be liberated from the gravitational field when the gas cloud collapses?\n\n- What is the total gravitational self-energy of a sphere of mass M and radius R? (i.e. how much energy would it take to unbind the cloud?)\n\nWe can get a rough estimate by making a crude approximation:\n- Two half-spheres, each mass $M/2$ come together\n- Their approximate centres are a distance $R$ apart\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nE_G &= -\\frac{G\\left(\\frac{M}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{M}{2}\\right)}{R} \\\\\n&= -\\frac{GM^2}{R}\\times\\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{align}\n\nTo make a more precise estimate we need to know how the density changes at difference radii.\n\nIf we assume a uniform density, we get\n\\begin{align}\nE_G = -\\frac{GM^2}{R}\\times\\frac{3}{5}\n\\end{align}\n\nSo we can remember that in a realistic situation the result will be $\\approx\\frac{GM^2}{R}$ times a small factor.\n\nSo the energy released from the gravitational field as the cloud collapses will be $E_{init} - E_{final}$. If the cloud starts out very large we can assume $E_{init}\\approx =0$ and so the energy available is\n$$\\approx \\frac{GM^2}{R}$$\n\n## Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale\n\nAs we have seen before, the lifetime of the Sun if it were powered by heat left over from its contraction is\n$\\tau_{KH}= \\frac{GM_\\odot^2}{R_\\odot L_\\odot}$, the Kelvin=Helmholtz or _thermal_ timescale.\n\nFor the Sun this is about $10^7$ years. This is roughly the time it takes a $1 M_\\odot$ protostar to collapse.\n\n- This time is quite short by astronomical standards.\n- This is the reason we do not see many protostars.\n\nFor a $1M_\\odot$ protostar, after about 10000 years, it will have\n- $T=2000-3000 K$\n- $R\\approx 20R_\\odot$\n- $L\\approx 100 L_\\odot$\n\nFor a $0.08 M_\\odot$ star, the pressure and temperature are never high enough to trigger nuclear fusion.\n- It will still shine for its Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale though - a brown dwarf\n- Planets also have residual heat left over from their formation. Jupiter gives off twice as much heat as it receives from the Sun!\n\n## Hayashi Tracks\n\n- This evolutionary path for the proto-star moves it around on the HR diagram.\n- T-Tauri variable stars (see part 1.3) are examples of unstable protostars evolving toward stability.\n- For low-mass stars ($<3M_\\odot$) this is mostly vertical motion downward until the proto-star hits the main sequence.\n- During this phase the protostar is unstable - remember T-Tauri variables!\n\n## Henyey Tracks\n\nHigher mass stars have another phase:\n- As the star continues to heat up, the gas in the cloud becomes fully ionised.\n- No un-ionised atoms to provide atomic absorption lines - the gas becomes transparent in its diffuse outer regions\n- The protostar slowly contracts until the onset of nuclear reactions in the core\n- This slow contraction with an increase in temperature produces a nearly horizontal track on the HR diagram - slight luminosity increase with large temperature increase.\n\n![Pre Main Sequence Evolution](img/PreMainSequence.jpg)\n\n## Pre-main-sequence Stars\n\nAll have distinctive characteristics :\n- unstable luminosity\n- eject lots of gas\n- surrounded by warm clouds (from which they formed)\n- T Tauri stars are a good example of pre-MS stars\n\n<img class=\"right_panel\" style=\"max-width: 40%\" src=\"img/PolarOutflow.png\">\n\n- Young stars also exhibit ‘bipolar outflows’\n- these are jets of material in opposite directions extending over a distance scale of about 1 lightyear\n- the jets indicate that the new star is gaining material from a surrounding accretion disk\n\n## Bipolar outflow from protostar HH211\n\n![HH211](img/HH211.jpg)\n\n## Emission Nebulae\n\n- Young stars are also often surrounded by emission nebulae\n- these are known as HII regions\n- The UV light from a hot star ( ~ 20000 K) sweeps out a cavity and ionises the surrounding hydrogen\n- Recombination produces Hɑ and other emissions as well \n- overall a red glow\n\n- The Orion, Eagle, Trifid and Lagoon nebulae are all (beautiful) examples of emission nebulae\n\n![Orion](img/Orion.jpg)\n\n![Triffid](img/Triffid.jpg)\n\n![Eagle](img/Eagle.jpg)\n\n![Lagoon](img/Lagoon.jpg)\n\n## Cloud Collapse\n\n### What conditions result in cloud collapse?\n\n\nThe __Virial Theorem__ states that the total kinetic energy of a stable, self-gravitating mass distribution, is negative one half of the total gravitational potential energy\n$$K.E = -\\frac{1}{2} P.E.$$\n\nThis helps us calculate the conditions that must exist for cloud collapse\n\n- The number of particles with mass $m_p$ in the cloud (total mass $M_c$) is $N = M_c/m_p$\n- The potential energy of a spherical cloud with uniform density is\n$$E_G = -\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{GM_c^2}{R_c}$$\n\n- The cloud is a _gas_\n\nThe kinetic energy of each particle in the gas is the thermal energy $\\frac{3}{2}k_B T$\n\nSo the total K.E. is $$E_K = \\frac{3M_c}{2m_p}k_B T $$\n\nSo the Virial Theorem tells us\n\n$$\n\\frac{3M_c}{2m_p}k_BT = -\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{GM_c^2}{R_c}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe cloud will collapse if the virial theorem is unbalanced, i.e.\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{3M_c}{2m_p}k_BT &< -\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{GM_c^2}{R_c}\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{k_BT}{m_p} &< \\frac{1}{5} \\frac{GM_c}{R_c}\n\\end{align}\n\nSo for a cloud of radius $R_c$ at temperature $T$, collapse will happen if\n$$\nM_C > \\frac{5k_BTR_c}{m_p G}\n$$\n\nIf the cloud has initial density $$\\rho_0 = \\frac{M_c}{(4/3)\\pi R_c^3}$$\nthen\n$$\nR_C = \\left(\\frac{3M_C}{4\\pi\\rho_0}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nSubstituting into previous expression for collapse we find\n$$\nM_C > \\frac{5k_BT}{m_p G}\\left(\\frac{3M_C}{4\\pi\\rho_0}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n\n### Jeans mass\nSo, simplifying we find the necessary mass for a cloud to collapse is\n$$\nM_C > \\left(\\frac{5k_B T}{m_P G}\\right)^{3/2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4\\pi\\rho_0}\\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThis critical mass is called the __Jeans Mass__, $M_J$.\n- A cloud with $M_C>M_J$ will collapse under gravity\n\nFor a dense interstellar gas cloud we have $\\rho_0 = m_p \\times 10^{14} = 1.67\\times10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$. If we assume an initial temperature $T\\approx 10 K$.\n\nThen $M_J \\approx 6\\times 10^{29}\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}M_\\odot$.\n- So we can roughly predict the mass of a star!\n- Real collapsing clouds fragment and have a range of temperatures and shapes so this is very rough\n\nInitially the collapse is essentially free-fall.\n- The cloud can radiate away the liberated energy as the density is low\n- Temperature remains fairly constant until the late stages\n\n### Cloud collapse - temperature\n\nUsing the Virial theorem we can also predict the temperature of the cloud once it reaches equilibrium\n- Denote the final state with subscript $*$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{3}{2}k_BT_*\\frac{M_*}{m_p} &= \\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{3}{5}\\times \\frac{GM_*^2}{R_*} \\\\\nT_* &= \\frac{GM_*m_p}{5k_BR_*}\n\\end{align}\n\nFor a $1 M_\\odot$ star with radius $1 R_\\odot$, and $m_p=1.66\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ we find\n$$\nT_*\\approx 4\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\n- Given the rather crude approximations this isn't a bad estimate for the core temperature of the star\n\nSo, for a large enough $M_*/R_*$ ratio the temperature becomes high enough to fuse Hydrogen into Helium.\n- The temperature released by fusion provides the energy needed to stabilise the cloud against further contraction\n\n## The proto-star becomes a star\n\n# Main sequence Stars\n\n### Nuclear fusion\n\nWe have seen that fusing 4 Hydrogen nuclei into a Helium nucleus is a plausible mechanism for producing stellar energy.\n- We had assumed that all the star's mass is available for fusion\n- Collision of 4 H nuclei is incredibly unlikely.\n- Fusion is much more likely in a series of steps involving two-particle fusion\n- This is called the p-p chain reaction\n\n![P-P chain reaction](img/ppchain.png)\n\n## The p-p chain reaction\n\n1. Two mass-1 isotopes of Hydrogen (protons) undergo a simultaneous fusion and beta decay, producing a positron, a neutrino and a mass-2 isotope of Hydrogen (deuterium)\n$$^1H +\\ ^1H \\rightarrow \\beta^+ + \\nu +\\ ^2H$$\n\n2.
