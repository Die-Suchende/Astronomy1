Why and how do they form?\n- ? What is their energy source?\n- ? What happens when it runs out?\n\nTo make progress with the last three questions we will need to develop better models of the physics going on *inside* a star. This is difficult as we do not have direct access to the interior, but we can use physical models to find out!\n\n# Stellar lifetime and energy sources\n\nWe have seen from the HR diagram (@fig-HR-diagram-LT-CM) that most stars lie on the main sequence, but that there are giants and dwarfs. We account for this by proposing that stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence and less time in the other states.\n\n__How old is the Sun?__\n\nWe know from radioisotope dating that the Solar System has existed for about 4.6 billion years.\n\n- Life on Earth has existed for about 4 billion years, indicating the presence of liquid water (and therefore a hot Sun).\n- Radioactive dating techniques on Moon rocks estimated that this is about 4 billion years old, therefore the Sun must be older!\n\n__What powers the Sun?__\n\n## Solar energy source\n\nWe know the mass of the Sun $M_\\odot \\approx 2\\times 10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nWe know it radiates with luminosity $L_\\odot \\approx 4\\times 10^{26}\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n\nThe age of the solar system is at least $\\tau_\\odot \\approx 4.6\\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{years} \\approx 1.5\\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nWe can work out how much energy is required to keep the Sun shining $E\\approx \\tau_\\odot L_\\odot$.\n\nWe can define the __efficiency__ of the Sun's energy source in Joules / kg (how much energy one kg of the Sun's mass produces):\n\n$$\n\\epsilon_\\odot = \\frac{E}{M_\\odot} \\ge \\frac{\\tau_\\odot L_\\odot}{M_\\odot}\\implies \\epsilon_\\odot \\ge 3\\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}.\n$${#eq-sun-efficiency}\n\n__We need to find a source for all this energy.__\n\n## Chemical energy?\nChemical reactions involve rearrangements of electrons in atoms and molecules.\n\n- We have seen the natural units for these processes are electron-volts: $1.6\\times 10^{-19}$ J\n- Compare this to the mass per atom $\\approx m_p = 1.7\\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n\nTherefore the efficiency of chemical reactions is\n$$\n\\epsilon_C \\approx \\frac{1.6\\times10^{-19}}{1.7\\times 10^{-27}} \\approx 1\\times 10^8 \\mathrm{J/kg}.\n$${#eq-chemical-efficiency}\n\nComparing this to @eq-sun-efficiency, you can see that $\\epsilon_C\\approx \\epsilon_\\odot/10^5$.\n\nIf chemical reactions were the source of the Sun's power, this would last only\n$$\n\\tau_C \\approx \\frac{M_\\odot \\epsilon_C}{L_\\odot} = 15\\,000\\,\\mathrm{years}\\approx \\tau_\\odot/10^5.\n$${#eq-lifetime-chemical}\n\nThis is >100000 times too short!\n- The Sun is not powered by chemical reactions.\n\n## Gravitational Energy?\n\nGravitational potential energy for a proton coming from $\\infty$ to a radius $R$\n\n$$\nE_G=\\frac{GMm_p}{R}\n$${#eq-gravitational-energy-mp}\n\nSo the efficiency is\n$$\n\\epsilon_G \\approx \\frac{E_G}{m_p}=\\frac{GM}{R} \\approx 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{J/kg}.\n$${#eq-gravitational-efficiency}\n\nThis is greater than the chemical energy efficiency found in @eq-chemical-efficiency.\n\nEstimate lifetime the same way:\n$$\n\\tau_G=\\frac{M_\\odot \\epsilon_G}{L_\\odot} \\approx 1.6\\times10^{7}\\mathrm{years}\\approx \\tau_\\odot/100.\n$${#eq-gravitational-lifetime}\n\nThis is about 100 times too small - the Sun is not powered by ongoing gravitational collapse.\nHowever, this is a large amount of energy, we will see later how important it is.\n\n### Introduction to the Kelvin-Helmoltz timescale\n\nKelvin performed this calculation himself. The timescale of @eq-gravitational-lifetime is called the __Kelvin-Helmholtz Timescale__. It determines how quickly a star radiates the energy accumulated by gravitational collapse before nuclear fusion sets in. We will discuss this later in this chapter.\n\n__On the Age of the Sun’s Heat__\n\nBy Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)\nMacmillan's Magazine, vol. 5 (March 5, 1862), pp. 388-393\n\n“As for the future, we may say, with equal certainty, that inhabitants of the earth can not continue to enjoy the light and heat essential to their life for many million years longer _unless sources now unknown to us are prepared in the great storehouse of creation._”\n\nSensibly he hedged his bets in the final sentence!\n\nKelvin did not know about the theory of relativity, $E=mc^2$ and atomic nucleii. Let us look to these for the power we need.\n\n## Relativistic energy\n\nEinstein discovered the relationship between mass and energy, the famous $E=mc^2$ for a mass at rest.\n\nFor the total conversion of mass to energy we have an energy efficiency\n$$\n\\epsilon_R = \\frac{mc^2}{m} = c^2 = 9\\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{J/kg}.\n$${#eq-relativistic-efficiency}\n\nIf total conversion was the energy source, we would have\n$$\n\\tau_R = \\frac{M_\\odot c^2}{L_\\odot} = 3\\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{years} \\approx 10^4\\tau_\\odot \n$${#eq-relativistic-timescale}\n\nThis would be long enough to keep the Sun bright!\n\nHowever, this complete conversion requires an equal amount of matter and antimatter.\n\n- We do not see the signature gamma rays from matter annihilation\n- If half the Sun were anti-matter what would prevent explosive annihilation?\n\nThe Sun is not powered by matter annihilation.\n\n## Nuclear Fusion\n\nWe need a way to turn mass into energy in a controlled way.\n\n- Under conditions of very high temperature and very high density, several light nuclei can fuse to form a single nucleus\n- The newly formed nucleus has a slightly lower mass than the combination of the separate nuclei\n- This mass deficit $\\Delta m$ is released as fusion energy $\\Delta E = \\Delta m c^2$.\n\n* In the Sun, four Hydrogen nucleii (protons) fuse together to form a Helium-4 nucleus (alpha particle).\n* Energy is released in the form of radiation (gamma-rays) and neutrinos.\n\n![Nuclear fusion in the Sun. Four Hydrogen nucleii fuse releasing energy and creating a Helium-4 nucleus and a neutrino.](img/H-He.png){#fig-nuclear-fusion}\n\n\n### Energy budget\n\nTo calculate $\\Delta E = \\Delta m c^2$ we need the mass of a Helium nucleus $m_\\alpha$ and the mass of the proton $m_p$.\n\n- $m_p = 1.673\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $4 m_p = 6.690\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $m_\\alpha = 6.644\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n\nSo $\\Delta m = 4m_p - m_\\alpha = 0.046 \\times 10^{-27}\\,$kg.\n\nAnd $\\Delta E = \\Delta m c^2 = 4.127 \\times 10^{-12}\\,$J. This is the energy available in one H-He fusion reaction.\n\nSo\n$$\n\\epsilon_\\mathrm{Fusion} =\\frac{\\Delta E}{m_p} = 2.47\\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}\n$${#eq-efficiency-fusion}\nand the lifetime would be\n$$\n\\tau_\\mathrm{Fusion} = \\frac{M_\\odot \\epsilon_\\mathrm{Fusion}}{L_\\odot} = 4\\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{years}\n$${#eq-lifetime-fusion}\n\nThis is around 100 times the age of the Sun. Is this plausible?\n- Yes, if we do not assume that all of the Sun's mass undergoes fusion.\n\n# Stellar Formation\n\nWe have verified the general picture of stars as fusion-powered for most of their lifetimes. But let's back-track and look again at that energy from gravitational collapse, because we had asked the question: _Why and how do stars form?_\n\nWe know that stars have a finite lifetime, so they must have been born at some point in the past.\nFor the Sun this was about 4.6 billion years ago. __Gravity__ is the key player.\n\nWhat did it form from? _Interstellar gas cloud._\n\nThe galaxy is full of Hydrogen and Helium produced in the big bang, and dust and gas left over from previous generations of stars (Population II).\n\n- If it is not completely uniform then gravity will cause clumps to collapse.\n\n- As it collapses, the gas heats up (gravitational potential energy is converted to thermal energy).\n\nLet's compare some densities.\n\n| Object | Number density (particles / $m^3$) |\n|--------|------------------------------------|\n| Earth's atmosphere | $2.5\\times 10^{25}$ |\n| Laboratory vacuum | $1\\times 10^{16}$ |\n| 'Dense' Interstellar cloud | $1\\times 10^{14}$ |\n| 'Average' Interstellar Cloud | $1\\times 10^{13}$ |\n\nThe density in interstellar clouds is very low, so we need a lot of mass ($>100 M_\\odot$) to collapse under gravity.\n\n- If the cloud is initially rotating even slightly, the rotation speed increases as material collapses inward\n- Spinning material flattens into a __protoplanetary disc__\n\n- The dense central part forms a protostar\n- Surrounding material continues to accrete onto the protostar\n- The temperature rises, and the gas becomes ionised\n- Eventually, if enough material is accreted, the temperature becomes high enough to initiate nuclear fusion - a star is born!\n- Radiation from the hot star pushes material out until equilibrium is reached.\n\n![How star are formed.](img/HowStarsAreFormed.jpg){#fig-stars-formation}\n\n![Simulation of protostar forming from an interstellar gas cloud.](img/cluster1mre.avi.mp4)\n\n![The Eagle Nebula showing recently formed stars.](img/EagleNebula.jpg){#fig-eagle-nebula}\n\n![Protoplantery disk around nearby star Formalhaut](img/Formalhaut.jpg){#fig-protoplanetary-disk}\n\n## Protostars\n\nLet's model this cloud collapse in a bit more detail.\n\nFrom the previous simulation we see that initial non-uniformities are amplified by gravity. The cloud fragments as it collapses and each fragment produces a proto-star.\n\nThe temperature of the proto-star increases as gravitational potential energy is converted to heat.\n\n- Initially, the temperature of the interstellar cloud is 10s of Kelvin.\n\n- The interstellar medium (ISM) is made mainly of Hydrogen in the ground state, therefore it cannot produce emission lines\n\n- Dust in the interstellar medium re-emits radiation absorbed approximately as blackbody emission in the far-infrared\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{peak} = 0.0029 / T_\\mathrm{eff} \\approx 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$${#eq-peak-wavelength-ism}\n\n- Radiation in the far-infrared is too long-wavelength to trigger absorption transitions and generate absorption lines (photons in the UV would be required)\n\n- The cloud is very diffuse\n- Radiation prevents the temperature from increasing very rapidly\n\nRemember Stefan-Boltzmann Law\n$$ L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$$\n\nAt first $T$ is low, but $R$ is very large (hundreds of a.u.).\n\n- As the cloud collapses, the temperature rises slowly to begin with\n- But luminosity is decreasing as $R$ gets smaller\n- The temperature eventually begins to rise in the core of the cloud\n\n### Gravitational Collapse - Energy budget\n\nHow much energy will be liberated from the gravitational field when the gas cloud collapses?\n\n- What is the total gravitational self-energy of a sphere of mass M and radius R? (i.e. how much energy would it take to unbind the cloud?)\n\nWe can get a rough estimate by making a crude approximation:\n\n- Two half-spheres, each mass $M/2$ come together\n- Their approximate centres are a distance $R$ apart.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy of the two half-spheres is\n\n$$\nE_G = -\\frac{G\\left(\\frac{M}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{M}{2}\\right)}{R} = -\\frac{GM^2}{R}\\times\\frac{1}{4}.\n$${#eq-half-sphere-gpe}\n\nThis is a rough estimate, but in the 'Stellar Structure and Evolution' course you will see that with a more precise derivation you will need to know how the density changes at different radii.\n\nIf we assume a uniform density, we get\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nE_G = -\\frac{GM^2}{R}\\times\\frac{3}{5}.\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-self-gravitating-pe}\n\nSo we can remember that in a realistic situation the result will be $\\approx\\frac{GM^2}{R}$ times a small factor.\n\nThe energy released from the gravitational field as the cloud collapses will be $E_{lib}=E_{init} - E_{final}$. If the cloud starts out very large we can assume $E_{init}\\simeq 0$, so the energy available is\n$$\nE_{lib}=E_G\\approx \\frac{GM^2}{R}.\n$${#eq-collapse-grav-energy}\n\n_What is the timescale associated to the energy liberated from the gravitational collapse (converted to heat)?_\n\n### Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale\n\nThe timescale associated to the liberation of the energy obtained from the gravitational collapse can be derived using @eq-collapse-grav-energy and dividing this by the luminosity $L$ of the star:\n$$\n\\tau_{KH} = \\frac{E_G}{L} \\approx \\frac{GM^2}{R L}.\n$${#eq-kelvin-helmoltz-timescale}\n\nThis is the _Kelvin-Helmoltz timescale_ (or _thermal timescale_) already encountered earlier in this chapter (@eq-gravitational-lifetime), and it is the lifetime of a star if it were powered by heat left over from its contraction.\n\nWe saw that for the Sun this is about $10^7$ years: this is roughly the time it takes a $1 M_\\odot$ protostar to collapse.\n\n- This time is quite short by astronomical standards, and this is the reason we do not see many protostars.\n\nFor a $1M_\\odot$ protostar, after about 10000 years, it will have\n\n- $T=2000-3000 K$\n- $R\\approx 20R_\\odot$\n- $L\\approx 100 L_\\odot$.\n\nFor a $0.08 M_\\odot$ star, the pressure and temperature are never high enough to trigger nuclear fusion.\n\n- It will still shine for its Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale though - a brown dwarf\n- Planets also have residual heat left over from their formation. Jupiter gives off twice as much heat as it receives from the Sun!\n\n## Pre-main-sequence stars\n\n### Hayashi Tracks\n\nBefore reaching the main sequence, protostars will follow 'tracks' in the HR diagram based on changes of their properties such as temperature and luminosity.\n\n- T-Tauri variable stars (see Chapter 3) are examples of unstable protostars evolving toward stability.\n- After ending its contraction, a protostar becomes a T-Tauri and it is very luminous\n- This evolutionary path for the protostar moves it around on the HR diagram\n- For low-mass stars ($<3M_\\odot$) this is mostly vertical motion downward until the proto-star hits the main sequence\n- This almost vertical motion is __the Hayashi track__: the star's temperature does not change much but the luminosity drops quickly (e.g. lines 1 and 2 in @fig-pre-main-sequence-hr)\n- During this phase the protostar is unstable - remember T-Tauri variables!\n\n\n### Henyey Tracks\n\nFor stars with mass $<3M_\\odot$, after the Hayashi track (nearly vertical line in the HR diagram, and drop of luminosity), there is an increase in luminosity (e.g. line 3 in @fig-pre-main-sequence-hr).\nThis is due to the temperature starting to rise in the star, which increases the luminosity (remember the Stefan-Boltzmann equation).\n\nHigher mass stars have another phase:\n\n- As the star continues to heat up, the gas in the cloud becomes fully ionised.\n- No un-ionised atoms to provide atomic absorption lines - the gas becomes transparent in its diffuse outer regions\n- The protostar slowly contracts until the onset of nuclear reactions in the core\n- This slow contraction with an increase in temperature produces a nearly horizontal track on the HR diagram - slight luminosity increase with large temperature increase.\n\nThe horizontal lines in the HR diagram for more massive stars, as well as the lines where the luminosity increases for low-mass stars, are the __Henyey tracks__ (e.g. lines 3,5,9 in @fig-pre-main-sequence-hr).\n\n![Pre-Main-Sequence evolution showing the Hayashi and Henyey tracks.](img/PreMainSequence.jpg){#fig-pre-main-sequence-hr}\n\n\nAll the pre-main-sequence stars have distinctive characteristics :\n\n- unstable luminosity\n- eject lots of gas\n- surrounded by warm clouds (from which they formed)\n- T Tauri stars are a good example of pre-MS stars.\n\nYoung stars also exhibit ‘bipolar outflows’:\n\n- these are jets of material in opposite directions extending over a distance scale of about 1 lightyear\n- the jets indicate that the new star is gaining material from a surrounding accretion disk\n\n![Bipolar outflow in a young star surrounded by the accretion disk.](img/PolarOutflow.png){#fig-bipolar-outflow-protostar}\n\n![Simulation of bipolar outflow from protostar HH211.](img/HH211.jpg){#fig-hh211}\n\n![Bipolar outflow from protostar HH211: a comparison between the Spitzer ST and JWST observations.](img/HH211_meme.png){#fig-hh211-meme}\n\n## Emission Nebulae\n\n- Hot young stars ($T\\geq 20000$K) are also often surrounded by emission nebulae, known as __HII regions__\n- Such hot stars emit UV light that has enough energy to ionise the Hydrogen in the surrounding cloud of ISM\n- HII regions at equilibrium: recombination must happen at the same rate as ionisation\n- Recombination produces Hɑ and other emissions as well, generating an overall red glow.\n\nThe reason why Hɑ lines are produced is that, during the recombination, the electrons do not go straight to the ground state, but cascade down from higher states.\n\n- The Orion, Eagle, Trifid and Lagoon nebulae (@fig-orion - @fig-lagoon) are all (beautiful) examples of emission nebulae\n\n![Orion nebula.](img/Orion.jpg){#fig-orion}\n\n![Triffid nebula.](img/Triffid.jpg){#fig-triffid}\n\n![Eagle nebula.](img/Eagle.jpg){#fig-eagle}\n\n![Lagoon nebula.](img/Lagoon.jpg){#fig-lagoon}\n\n## Cloud Collapse conditions\n\n__What conditions result in cloud collapse?__\n\n### Virial Theorem\n\nThe __Virial Theorem__ states that the total kinetic energy of a stable, self-gravitating mass distribution, is negative one half of the total gravitational potential energy\n$$\nK.E. = -\\frac{1}{2} P.E.\n$${#eq-virial-theorem}\n\nThis helps us calculate the conditions that must exist for cloud collapse.\n\n- For a cloud of mass $M_c$, the number of particles with mass $m_p$ in the cloud is $N = M_c/m_p$\n- The potential energy of a spherical cloud with uniform density is given by @eq-self-gravitating-pe:\n$$\nE_G = -\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{GM_c^2}{R_c}.\n$${#eq-cloud-pe}\n\nThe cloud is a _gas_, and the kinetic energy of each particle in the gas is the thermal energy $\\frac{3}{2}k_B T$.\n\n- The total K.E. is\n$$\nE_K = \\frac{3M_c}{2m_p}k_B T.\n$${#eq-cloud-ke}\n\nSo the Virial Theorem tells us that for the cloud to be in equilibrium, the following equation must be valid\n\n$$\n\\frac{3M_c}{2m_p}k_BT = -\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{GM_c^2}{R_c}\\right).\n$${#eq-virial-cloud}\n\nThe cloud will collapse if the virial theorem is unbalanced, i.e. ($E_k < -1/2 E_G$):\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{3M_c}{2m_p}k_BT &< -\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{GM_c^2}{R_c}\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{k_BT}{m_p} &< \\frac{1}{5} \\frac{GM_c}{R_c}.\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-virial-cloud-unbalanced}\n\n### Jeans mass \n\nIt follows that for a cloud of radius $R_c$ at temperature $T$, collapse will happen if\n$$\nM_C > \\frac{5k_BTR_c}{m_p G}.\n$${#eq-mass-cloud-collapse}\n\nIf the cloud has initial density $\\rho_0 = \\frac{M_c}{(4/3)\\pi R_c^3},$ then\n$$\nR_C = \\left(\\frac{3M_C}{4\\pi\\rho_0}\\right)^{1/3}\n$${#eq-radius-cloud}\nSubstituting into previous expression for collapse we find\n$$\nM_C > \\frac{5k_BT}{m_p G}\\left(\\frac{3M_C}{4\\pi\\rho_0}\\right)^{1/3}.\n$${#eq-mass-cloud-collapse2}\n\nSo, simplifying we find the necessary mass for a cloud to collapse is\n$$\nM_C > \\left(\\frac{5k_B T}{m_P G}\\right)^{3/2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4\\pi\\rho_0}\\right)^{1/2}.\n$${#eq-jeans-mass}\nThis critical mass is called the __Jeans Mass__, $M_J$.

While travelling toward the outer part of the star, photons are constantly being absorbed and re-emitted by atoms. They \"random walk\" their way out of a star.\n\n- Hydrogen is converted to Helium in the core\n- Very little Helium escapes\n- Both radiation and convection transport heat energy from the core to the surface\n\nHow efficient radiative transport is then depends on the absorbing power of the medium (called _opacity_).\n\n- If the medium absorbs a lot of photons, then the radiative transport is low and photons can’t travel quickly and far.\n\nWhether radiative or convection mechanism dominate depends on the mass, temperature and structure of the stars.\n\n- Opacity is the capacity of absorbing photons to ionize or excite atoms.\n- In low mass stars, like the Sun, the outer envelope temperature is not high enough and hydrogen is not ionized. Soigher energy photons coming from the interior of the star are easily absorbed by the hydrogen - the outer portions of low mass stars have high opacity, and are thus convective.\n- In high mass stars, the temperature is high enough that the hydrogen stays ionized in the outer part, so radiation is not so easily absorbed - the outer layer of high mass stars is radiative.\n- The nuclear fusion mechanism in high mass stars is mainly CNO cycle, which has a strong temperature dependance, so it is too strong for radiative transport - the core of high mass stars is convective.\n\n@fig-stellar-interior shows different energy transport mechanisms taking place inside stars of different masses.\n\n- Stars of mass similar to the one of the Sun have a central bulk where energy is radiated, while the outer layer is a convection zone\n- Stars with $M>1.5M_\\odot$ are convective in their centers because the CNO cycle is more dependent on the temperature as compared to the pp chain\n- Stars with mass $<0.5 M_\\odot$ are not hot enough to trigger nuclear fusion, so their energy transport mechanism is mainly convective.\n\n![Stellar interiors.](img/stellar_interiors.png){#fig-stellar-interior}\n\n# Recap\n\n- Stars like the Sun are mainly powered by nuclear fusion (for $M>0.08 M_\\odot$)\n- The main nuclear fusion mechanisms are p-p and CNO cycles\n- Protostars are formed when a ISM cloud collapses, spinning and attracting more surrounding material, while slowly getting hotter\n- When the protostar is hot enough, nuclear fusion of hydrogen begins and the protostar becomes a star\n- The liberation of gravitational energy from the collapse, converted to heat and powering the star, is regulated by the Kelvin-Helmoltz timescale\n- Pre-main-sequence stars move on the HR diagram following Hayashi and Henyey tracks\n- The virial theorem states that for a stable self-gravitating mass, the kinetic energy is half the gravitational potential energy (remember the minus sign)\n- An ISM cloud collapses if its mass is larger than the Jeans mass\n- The interior of stars can transport energy by radiative transport and convection.\n\n",
