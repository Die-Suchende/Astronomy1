implications\n\n- The most massive stars are the most luminous\n- The amount of fuel available is proportional to the star's mass, so we can work out the main-sequence lifetime\n$$\n\\tau \\propto \\frac{M}{L} \\propto M^{-2.5}\n$$\n\n- So more massive stars evolve faster and spend less time on the main sequence\n\n# Main sequence turnoff\n\n![Main Sequence Turnoff](img/main_sequence_turnoff.png)\n\n# Main sequence lifetime\n\n- Let's assume that stars leave the main sequence when they convert 20% of their hydrogen fuel into helium\n- If this releases $\\Delta E$ Joules of energy per kilogram of hydrogen, then Luminosity = total energy released / main sequence lifetime:\n\n$$\nL=\\frac{0.2 M \\Delta E}{\\tau_{MS}}\n$$\n\n- We can use the mass-luminosity relationship to find $L$\n- Then we can find the time on the Main Sequence, $\\tau_{MS}$.\n- We can use the Sun as a reference point to get around the unknown constants\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{MS}&=\\frac{0.2 M \\Delta E}{L}\\\\\n\\tau_{MS\\odot}&=\\frac{0.2 M_\\odot \\Delta E}{L_\\odot}\\\\\n\\end{align}\nDivide the top by the bottom:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{MS}}{\\tau_{MS\\odot}}= \\frac{M}{M_\\odot}\\frac{L_\\odot}{L} = \\left(\\frac{M_\\odot}{M}\\right)^{2.5}\n$$\n\nWe know enough about the Sun to work out its main sequence lifetime:\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{MS\\odot}&=\\frac{0.2 M_\\odot \\Delta E_{H-He}}{L_\\odot}\\\\\n&= 2\\times 10^{10}\\mathrm{years}\n\\end{align}\n\n- The previous result shows that a star 4 times as massive as the Sun has a main sequence lifetime that is $4^{2.5}=32$ times shorter\n\nSo for a star on the main sequence,\n$\\tau_{MS}= 2\\times 10^{10} \\left(\\frac{M_\\odot}{M}\\right)^{2.5}$\n\n# Age of star clusters\n\n- The stars in any given cluster were all formed at about the same time but with a wide range of masses\n\n- The stars in any given cluster are all about the same distance away, so when we see differences in apparent brightness it is because of differences in intrinsic brightness\n\n- We can plot the stars in a cluster on an HR diagram\n- To find the age of a cluster, we look for the highest mass star still on the Main Sequence – a star near the top-left hand side of the HR-diagram\n- This star will allow us to determine the age of the cluster\n- The ages of clusters are important for determinations of the age of the Universe\n\n## Young versus old clusters\n\n![Young and old clusters](img/young_old_clusters.png)\n\n- M67 is a young (open) cluster\n    - for a young cluster you see more of the Main Sequence\n- M4 is an old (globular) cluster\n    - the Main Sequence lifetime is significantly shorter for the older cluster\n    - The location of the turnoff differs precisely because of the relationship derived earlier :\n\n$$\\tau_{MS} = 2\\times 10^{10} \\left(\\frac{M_\\odot}{M}\\right)^{2.5}\n$$\n\n## Evolution of low-mass stars ($\\sim 1 M_\\odot$)\n\n- Eventually H-He reactions runs out of fuel in the core\n- The radiation pressure then drops and gravity begins to triumph - the core collapses\n- The temperature of the core increases to $10^8$ K\n- Helium starts to fuse to carbon in the core\n    - this is the Triple Alpha process\n\n### Triple-alpha process\n\n\\begin{align}\n^4He +\\ ^4He \\rightarrow ^8Be+\\mathrm{energy} \\\\\n^4He +\\ ^8Be \\rightarrow ^{12}C+\\mathrm{energy} \\\\\n^4He +\\ ^{12}C \\rightarrow ^{16}C+\\mathrm{energy}\n\\end{align}\n\n- Three alpha particles ($^4He$) are used to make $^{16}C$\n\n### Helium Fusion in a low-mass star\n\n- Helium fusion is a highly exothermic process\n- the temperature of the core climbs further\n- Un-burned hydrogen around the core starts to fuse\n- the remaining hydrogen is fused to helium again\n\n- All this extra energy causes the luminosity to increase\n\n## Red Giants and Supergiants\n\nThe increased luminosity provides extra radiation pressure\n- the outer envelope of gas inflates and cools\n- for a star of $\\sim 1M_\\odot$, this equates to a radius of $\\sim 100R_\\odot$\n\nA high luminosity star with cool outer regions is called a __Red Giant__\n\nWhen the helium core burning stops there is a further collapse and rise in temperature\n- The shell of helium around the core starts to burn\n\n- The star becomes a Red Supergiant\n\n## Inside an evolved low-mass star\n![Evloved low mass star](img/evolved_low_mass.png)\n\n## Instability and evolution to White Dwarf\n\nThe star is now unstable!\n- it pulses slowly and its luminosity increases by a factor of about 10 over a period of about 5000 years\n\nThe outer layers separate and are blown off\n- a planetary nebula is formed and the hot core is exposed\n- this process accounts for about half the star’s mass\n- When all the helium fuel is used up, the star is supported by degeneracy pressure\n\nIt slowly cools to become a White Dwarf\n\n### Evolutionary track of a low mass star\n\n![Evolution](img/giant_to_dwarf.png)\n\n## NGC2440 planetary nebula\n\n![NGC2440](img/NGC2440.jpg)\n\n## Evolution of High Mass Stars ($\\ge 8M_\\odot$)\n\nEvolution is similar to that of low mass stars but there is added gravitational pressure due to the higher mass\n- higher temperatures are possible\n- more (different) nuclear reactions are possible\n\nAfter helium is used up, the core collapses until degeneracy sets in to stop the star shrinking\n- temperature goes up and helium-carbon fusion starts\n\n- This cycle repeats through heavier and heavier elements up to iron\n- The star consists of concentric shells – the onion model of the interior\n\n![Stellar layers](img/stellar_onion.png)\n\n### Iron Catastrophe\n\n- Fusion reactions are exothermic (release energy) only if the reactants are lighter than iron\n- Fission reactions (the other kind of nuclear reaction) are exothermic only if the reactants are heavier than iron\n- So after a certain point ( i.e. when iron has been produced) fusion stops producing energy and no other energy-producing nuclear process can take place\n\n![Nuclear binding energy](img/iron_catastrophe.png)\n\n# Supernova\n\n- At this point the core has no more nuclear fuel left to sustain the high temperature and pressure\n- But the core is too massive to be supported by degeneracy pressure, so\n    - the core collapses – in  ~ 0.25 seconds !\n    - resulting in the formation of a neutron star or a black hole\n    - the outer layers of the star are blown off – the supernova remnant\n\n| Event | Temperature (K) | Time |\n|-------|-----------------|------|\n| Hydrogen Burning | $4\\times 10^7$ | $7\\times 10^6$ years |\n| Helium Burning | $2\\times 10^{8}$ | $7\\times 10^5$ years |\n| Carbon Burning | $6\\times 10^8$ | 600 years |\n| Neon Burning | $1.2\\times 10^9$ | 1 year |\n| Oxygen Burning | $1.5\\times 10^9$ | 6 months |\n| Silicon Burning | $2.7 \\times 10^9$ | 1 day |\n| Core Collapse | $5.4\\times 10^9$ | 0.25 seconds |\n| Supernova! | -
