At this stage it is burning hydrogen through nuclear fusion at its core.\n:::\n\n\n![Main Sequence turnoff.

An example is M4 (shown in @fig-clusters - right).\n\n![Young (open) and old (globular) clusters M67 and M4, and their corresponding distribution of stars on the HR diagram.](img/young_old_clusters.png){#fig-clusters}\n\nWe can plot the stars in a cluster on an HR diagram.\n\nThe video below shows how stars from a globular cluster are catalogued on the HR diagram.\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY2edzGYWyU >}}\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's look at the examples in @fig-clusters.\n\n- M67 is a young (open) cluster\n    - for a young cluster you see more of the Main Sequence\n- M4 is an old (globular) cluster\n    - the Main Sequence lifetime is significantly shorter for the older cluster\n    - The location of the turnoff differs precisely because of the relationship derived earlier in @eq-ms-lifetime-wrt-ref:\n\n$$\\tau_{MS} = 2\\times 10^{10}\\mathrm{yr} \\left(\\frac{M_\\odot}{M}\\right)^{2.5}.\n$$\n\n- To find the age of a cluster, we look for the highest mass star still on the Main Sequence – a star near the top-left hand side of the HR-diagram\n- This star, at the turnoff point, will allow us to determine the age of the cluster\n- _The cluster age is equal to the main-sequence lifetime of the turnoff stars_\n- Use this mass of the stars at the turnoff point in @eq-ms-lifetime-wrt-ref to find the age of the cluster:\n$$\n\\tau_\\mathrm{{cluster}} = 2\\times 10^{10}\\mathrm{yr} \\left(\\frac{M_\\odot}{M_\\mathrm{{turnoff}}}\\right)^{2.5}.\n$${#eq-age-cluster}\nThe ages of clusters are important for determinations of the age of the Universe\n\n# Evolutions of stars - interactive simulator\n\n[Here](https://starinabox.lco.global/#) is a source to play with that is useful for the following, where we will see how stars of different masses evolve.\nTry to run it for low-mass stars and high-mass stars, monitoring the different stages of the evolution and how the position on the HR diagram, the radius, the temperature and the luminosity of the stars change during the simulation.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://starinabox.lco.global/#\" title=\"starinabox\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n# Evolution of low-mass stars ($\\sim 1 M_\\odot$)\n\n![Evolution of low-mass stars tracked on the HR diagram.](img/evolution-sun.jpg){#fig-post-ms-sun}\n\n## Hydrogen fusion\n\n- While the star burns Hydrogen, the mean molecular weight $\\mu$ at the core increases\n- According to the ideal gas law (@eq-ideal-gas-law2), to keep enough pressure and support the outer layers, the density of the core must increase, so the core is compressed\n- With the core compression, gravitational potential energy is released: half goes into thermal kinetic energy, as per virial theorem (@eq-virial-theorem), half is radiated away\n- The temperature starts increasing slowly and as a consequence the region where hydrogen fusion can happen also increases slightly\n- The increase in p-p chain nuclear reaction rate generates more radiation pressure and it increases the stars luminosity, radius and effective temperature.\n\n## Red Giants\n\n- Eventually H-He reactions stop in the core\n- The radiation pressure then drops and gravity begins to triumph - the core collapses \n- The temperature of the core increased to $10^8$ K\n- The Helium core is surrounded by a Hydrogen burning shell where nuclear fusion still occurs.\n\nAt the beginning of the chapter we mentioned that the nuclear timescale is the main one once the star enters the ZAMS, but when switching between nuclear sources, the KH timescale becomes important again because the star undergoes further variations in size.\n\nThe increased luminosity given by the hydrogen shell burning provides extra radiation pressure.\n\n- The outer envelope of gas inflates and cools\n- For a star of $\\sim 1M_\\odot$, this equates to a radius of $\\sim 100R_\\odot$\n- The star moves in the Red Giant Branch towards the right (red) in the HR diagram, as visible in @fig-post-ms-sun and @fig-post-ms-2.\n\nA high luminosity star with cool outer regions is called a __Red Giant__.\n\n## Helium fusion: Triple-alpha process\n\nAt this point Helium starts to fuse to carbon in the core. The fusion of helium is triggered by the _Helium flash_ (@fig-post-ms-sun, @fig-post-ms-2) and is due to the __triple-alpha process__ (@fig-triple-alpha).\n\n![Triple-Alpha process scheme. 3 Alpha particles ($^4He$) are used to make $^{12}C$.](img/Triple-Alpha_Process.svg){#fig-triple-alpha}\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n^4He +\\ ^4He \\rightarrow ^8Be+\\mathrm{energy} \\\\\n^4He +\\ ^8Be \\rightarrow ^{12}C+\\mathrm{energy} \\\\\n^4He +\\ ^{12}C \\rightarrow ^{16}C+\\mathrm{energy}\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-triple-alpha}\n\n- Three alpha particles ($^4He$) are used to make $^{12}C$, then another one is used to make $^{16}C$.\n\n- Helium fusion is a highly exothermic process (it releases a lot of heat)\n- The temperature of the core climbs further\n- More un-burned hydrogen fusion around the core \n- The core contracts, so the luminosity decreases and the effective temperature increases (see @fig-post-ms-sun).\n\n<!-- - This extra energy causes the luminosity to increase (vertical line in the HR diagram of @fig-post-ms-2 for a Sun-like star.) -->\n\n![Post-main-sequence evolution in the HR diagram.](img/post-ms.jpeg){#fig-post-ms-2}\n\n## Red Supergiants\n\nWhen the Helium core burning stops (after the Horizontal Branch), there is a further collapse and rise in temperature, where the star moves on the _Asymptotic (Giant) Branch_ in the HR diagram (@fig-post-ms-sun, @fig-post-ms-2).\n\n- The shell of Helium around the core starts to burn\n- Carbon ash core left from Helium fusion (see @fig-evolved-low-mass-star)\n- It pulses slowly and its luminosity increases by a factor of about 10 over a period of about 5000 years.\n\nThe star becomes a __Red Supergiant__.\n\n![Structure of an evolved low-mass star after the Helium core burning stops.](img/evolved_low_mass.png){#fig-evolved-low-mass-star}\n\n## Instability and evolution to White Dwarf\n\nThe star is now unstable!\n\n- The outer layers separate and are blown off\n- This process accounts for about half the star’s mass.\n\nA __planetary nebula__ is formed (see @fig-evolution-low-mass-star) and the hot core is exposed (despite the name, this has nothing to do with planets).\n\n- When all the helium fuel is used up, the star is supported by degeneracy pressure (we will discuss this further in Chapter 8).\n\nIt slowly cools to become a __White Dwarf__.\n\n![Evolutionary track of a low-mass star.](img/giant_to_dwarf.png){#fig-evolution-low-mass-star}\n\n\n![NGC2440 planetary nebula.](img/NGC2440.jpg){#fig-planetary-nebula}\n\n# Evolution of High-Mass Stars ($\\ge 8M_\\odot$)\n\nEvolution is similar to that of low mass stars but there is added gravitational pressure due to the higher mass and a convective core that mixes the elements.
