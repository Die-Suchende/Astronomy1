These each have a number density $n_e$ and $n_p,$ and since there is charge-balance, $n_e = n_p =n$. Therefore\n$$\n\\rho=n_e m_e + n_p m_p \\approx nm_p\n$${#eq-number-density}\nsince $m_{\\text{e}}\\ll m_{\\text{p}}$.\n\nThe number density is $n$, so this cube contains $n$ particles.\n\n- The particles must maintain their identities as different particles: the uncertainty in their positions cannot be larger than their physical separation.\n<!-- - By the _Pauli exclusion principle_  -->\n\nIf the typical spacing between each particle is $\\Delta x$, then each particle typically 'occupies' a volume of $\\langle V\\rangle=(\\Delta x)^{3}$, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\t\\Delta x &= \\frac{1}{n^{1/3}}, \\\\\n\tn &= 1/{\\langle V\\rangle}.\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-uncertainty-volume}\n\nTherefore, by the _Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle_ (note that this is an oversimplification and an approximation here), each particle has a momentum in the $x$-direction of\n$$\np_{x}\\approx \\Delta p_x \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta x}\\approx\\hbar n^{1/3}\\approx\\hbar\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_{\\text{p}}}\\right)^{1/3},\n$${#eq-momentum-particle}\nwhere we used @eq-number-density for $n$.\n\n<!-- where we consider stationary, cold particles, with no thermal motion -->\n\nFor non-relativistic particles (i.e. particle speed $v\\ll c$), the average kinetic energy of the particle is given by\n$$\n\\langle E_k \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}m\\langle v^{2}\\rangle\n=\\frac{\\langle mv\\rangle ^{2}}{2m}=\\frac{\\langle p^{2}\\rangle\n}{2m}=\\frac{3\\langle p_{x}^{2}\\rangle }{2m},\n$${#eq-avg-kinetic-en}\n\nwhere the non-relativistic particle momentum is $p=mv$ and $\\langle\\ldots\\rangle$ indicates\nan average. Also $p^{2} = p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}+p_{z}^{2}$ therefore $\\langle\np^{2}\\rangle = 3\\langle p_{x}^{2}\\rangle$.\n\nPlugging the result of @eq-momentum-particle in @eq-avg-kinetic-en, we find that the average quantum energy (or Fermi energy) of an electron is given by\n$$\n{\\langle E_e\\rangle =\n\\frac{3\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_p}\\right)^{2/3}},\n$${#eq-fermi-energy}\n\nand analogously for a proton this is given by\n$$\n{\\langle E_p \\rangle =\n\\frac{3\\hbar^{2}}{2m_p}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_p}\\right)^{2/3}}.\n$${#eq-proton-energy}\n\nNote some important properties of these equations:\n\n- They are only valid for _non-relativistic_ particles.\n- Since $m_e\\ll m_p$, we see that $\\langle E_e\\rangle \\gg \\langle E_p\\rangle$ and we will show that electron pressure __dominates__ over proton pressure for White Dwarf stars.\n\n# Pressure and kinetic energy\n\n![Box of particles of gas.](img/box1.jpg){#fig-box-gas}\n\n\n<!-- To find the degeneracy pressure, consider the work done by a particle in the box, pushing one of its faces by an infinitesimal amount $d x$, -->\nTo find the degeneracy pressure, consider the work done by changing the size of one side of a box by an infinitesimal amount $d x$, which changes the internal energy\n$$\ndE = -F d x\n$${#eq-work-done}\n<!-- The pressure of the gas is produced by the force the particles exert on the walls. -->\nBy definition of pressure, since a force is applied over an area $A$ ($P=F/A$), we can rewrite @eq-work-done as\n$$\nd E  = - (P A) d x = -P d V,\n$${#eq-internal-en-change}\nwhere we introduced $A d x = dV$, an infinitesimal change in the volume of the box.\n\n@eq-internal-en-change can then be rewritten as\n$$\nP = - \\frac{d E}{d V}.\n$${#eq-pressure-dedv}\n\nPressure is a measure of energy per volume.\n\nPressure is a macroscopic quantity, but we can relate it to the quantum mechanics of degeneracy pressure\nby considering the average kinetic energy per particle $\\langle E \\rangle$ and volume per particle $\\langle V \\rangle$.\n$$\nP= -\\frac{d \\langle E \\rangle}{d \\langle V \\rangle}\n$${#eq-partial-pressure}\nWe can now use\n$$\n{\\langle V \\rangle}^{-1}=\\rho / m_p\n$${#eq-volume-density}\nto relate this to the particle energies $\\langle E_e \\rangle$ and $\\langle E_p \\rangle$.\n\n## For electrons\n\nUsing @eq-fermi-energy, together with @eq-volume-density, the average energy for electrons can be rewritten as\n$$\n\\langle E_e \\rangle = \\frac{3\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_p}\\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{3\\hbar^2}{2m_e}{\\langle V \\rangle}^{-2/3}.\n$${#eq-eenergy-vol}\nTherefore from the definition in @eq-partial-pressure, the _partial pressure_ $P_{Qe}$ for electrons is\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nP_{Qe}&= -\\frac{3\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\frac{d {\\langle V \\rangle}^{-2/3}}{d {\\langle V \\rangle}} \\\\\n &= -\\frac{3\\hbar^2}{2m_e} \\times -\\frac{2}{3}{\\langle V \\rangle}^{-5/3} \\\\\n &\\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_e}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_p}\\right)^{5/3}\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-partial-q-pressure-el}\n\n## For protons\n\nAnalogously, using @eq-proton-energy, we can find the partial (quantum) pressure for protons:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nP_{Qp}\\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_p}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_p}\\right)^{5/3}.\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-parital-q-pressure-p}\nIn other words, we have\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{2}{3}n\\langle E \\rangle.\n$${#eq-pressure-propto-energy}\n\nThis derivation consisted in many approximations and some simplifications, but the full forms of the partial pressures have some prefactors:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nP_{Qe}= \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_e}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_p}\\right)^{5/3} \\quad \\quad\nP_{Qp}= \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_p}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m_p}\\right)^{5/3},\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-quantum-pressures}\nwhere $\\beta$ is dimensionless and of the order of unity.\n\n## Considerations\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n$T$ does not appear __anywhere__ in either equation, implying that a finite temperature is not required to provide this source of pressure -- it is indeed a __cold pressure__.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nNote also that the degeneracy pressure varies with density as $\\rho^{5/3}$.
