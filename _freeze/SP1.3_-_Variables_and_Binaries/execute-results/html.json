In this chapter we will look at the different types of variability and how we can explain them with our understanding of stellar physics. We will see that variable stars can be valuable sources of information that is difficult to get any other way.\n\n# Variable Stars Introduction\n\n- By ‘variable’ we mean that the star’s flux changes with time\n- We observe this by measuring changes in apparent magnitude\n\n_What can cause the magnitude to change?_\n\n- It can be a real variation because the star itself changes, or an apparent variation, e.g. something moves in front of the star and blocks its light fully, or partially, from us\n- The variation can be _irregular_ or _regular_.\n\n![HV1 Cepheid variable star in M31.](img/cepheid-variable.gif){#fig-cepheid-variable-gif}\n\n# Irregular variable stars\n\n## Irregular variable stars: Novae\n\n- All novae exist in binary systems in which material is transferred from one star to a white dwarf\n- As more matter is piled on, the gas gets hotter and more dense, until the thermonuclear fusion onset causes a bright outburst\n- Novae are sometimes called cataclysmic variables\n- They flare in brightness irregularly, sometimes only once\n- The interval between flares depends on the strength of the outburst: usually, the stronger the outburst, the longer the time before the next one\n- Their luminosity may increase by a factor of 1000 over a period of ~ a week and then decay slowly over months or years\n\n![Mass transfer in a binary system from the main sequence companion to the white dwarf, leading up to a nova.](img/nova.jpg){#fig-nova-mass-transfer}\n\n## Irregular Variable Stars: T Tauri Stars\n\nThis is a class of irregular variable stars named after their prototype: T Tauri in the constellation of Taurus.\n\n- Their luminosity increases by a factor of three in a few days\n- T Tauri stars are very young stars – _protostars_ that are powered by gravitational energy as they contract and move towards the Main Sequence\n- We will see where they fit into the stellar evolution later\n\n![Location of variables in the HR diagram.](img/variable-hr.png){#fig-variables-hr}\n\n\n\n## Irregular Variable Stars: Supernovae\n\n- Supernovae are end states of very massive stars, exploding after the nuclear fuel is exhausted\n- The core of a star collapses and the outer layers are blown off\n- What remains is: a small dense neutron star, surrounded by expanding spheres of circumstellar matter, or a black hole, or a diffuse nebula\n\nWe will study these in detail when we revisit the end stages of stellar evolution.\n\n### Introduction to supernovae types\n\nSupernovae are classified according to observational features.\nThere are two main classes of supernovae, determined by the chemical elements present in their spectra:\n\n  - Type I: do not contain Hydrogen. These are further divided into three subgroups: Ia (silicon is present), Ib (helium is present, but no silicon), and Ic (ittle helium, no silicon)\n  - Type II: their spectra contain Hydrogen lines.\n\nWe will learn how to classify them in chapter 7.\n\n### Type Ia Supernovae\n\n- Type Ia supernovae are important because they all have nearly equal brightness\n- They are \"standard candles\" which can be used to measure distance\n- This is used for cosmology!\n\nIn 2014 an example of such a Type Ia supernova (SN2014J) was seen in M82 – 11.4 million light years from us.\n\n- This was the brightest SN seen since SN1987A\n- We would only expect one such Type 1a SN in M82 every few decades\n\n![SN2014j](img/SN2014j.jpg){#fig-sn2014j}\n\n### Type II supernovae: Supernova 1987a\n\n![Supernova 1987a.](img/SN1987a.png){#fig-sn1987a}\n\n- SN1987a is the closest supernova of modern times\n- Exploded on February 23, 1987 in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n- Because of its closeness – only 168,000 light years – SN 1987A is the best-studied supernova of all time\n\n![One of the theories for the evolution of the supernova 1987a.

Examples are: RR Lyrae, Miras, Cepheids.\n\nWe will look more closely at Cepheids\nNamed after the star d Cephei which was first observed in 1786.\n\n## Cepheid Variable Stars\n\nCepheids are very luminous giant or supergiant stars.\n\n- Luminosity varies by factors of up to ten\n- Depending on the star, this variation repeats over periods between 1 and 100 days.\n- Example: Polaris (the Pole Star) has a period of about 4 days and changes its luminosity by about 5% over that period (see @fig-polaris-light-curve).\n\n![V-band apparent magnitude of Polaris.

They can give us some direct measurements of mass that are hard to come by without the mass-luminosity relationship.\n\n## Orbital analysis and masses determination\n\nWe know how to analyse orbits of planets in our solar system or satellites round the Earth.\n\nFor these cases one mass is huge compared to the other, so we approximate and deal with the orbit as if the larger mass is stationary.\n\nTreatment of the dynamics of binary systems is only slightly harder because the masses of the components can be more comparable.\nIn such a binary system, the stars orbit about their centre of mass – a point in between them.\n\nNewton and Kepler's laws still apply:\n\n- The centre of mass does not move (Newton 1)\n- Orbital motion is in a plane (conservation of angular momentum)\n- Both bodies feel the same attractive force, $F=\\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$\n- Orbits are ellipses, with the centre of mass at one focus (Kepler 1)\n\n![Orbits of a binary system. The centre of mass lies on the line connecting the two stars and the two stars orbit around it. $A_1$, $A_2$ denote the positions of the two stars at a given time. Same for the points B and C. $a_1$ and $a_2$ are the semi-major axes of the orbital ellipses.](img/orbital-binary.png){#fig-orbits-binary}\n\nA line between the two stars always passes through the centre of mass.\n\n[Here](https://astro.unl.edu/mobile/center-of-mass-simulator/index.html) (and below) you can try a simulator to visualise how the distances $r_1$, $r_2$ of the masses from the center of mass of the system vary, when you change $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://astro.unl.edu/mobile/center-of-mass-simulator/index.html\" title=\"CoMsimulator\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\nIf the masses are equal, the centre of mass is half way between them.\n\nIf the two masses are different, the centre of mass is closer to the heavier object.\n\nUsing the definition of the centre of mass:\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{r_2}{r_1} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}\n$${#eq-binary-orbital-com}\n\nwhere $a_1$, $a_2$ are the semi-major axes of the  orbital ellipses.\n\nKepler's laws of orbital motion apply to the orbits of both stars about the centre of mass, giving a relation for the orbital period $P$:\n\n$$\nP^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(m_1+m_2)}(a_1+a_2)^3\n$${#eq-orbital-period}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nNote that in @eq-orbital-period, the total mass $m_1+m_2$ appears, where if $m_1\\gg m_2$ one can be neglected in the planetary motion form of the law - c.f. Dynamical Astronomy.\nAlso, $a=a_1+a_2$ is the semi-major axis of the reduced mass.\n:::\n\n- Assume that we observe a binary system and the orbital plane is perpendicular to our line of sight\n- If the distance $d$ to the binary is known, and if we measure the angular separation of the stars from the centre of mass, $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$, then we can find the semi-major axes from\n$$\n\\alpha_1 = \\frac{a_1}{d}, \\quad \\alpha_2 = \\frac{a_2}{d}\n$${#eq-angular-separation-com-binaries}\n- If we also measure the period $P$, from @eq-orbital-period we can find the total mass of the system $m_1+m_2$.\n- Centre of mass dynamics tells us: $m_1a_1 = m_2a_2$\n- For visual binaries, we can measure both $a_1$ and $a_2$, so we can find $m_1/m_2$\n- Since we also know the total mass, after some algebra, we can deduce the individual masses $m_1$ and $m_2$\n\n$$\nm_1 = \\frac{(m_1+m_2)a_2}{a_1+a_2},\\quad m_2=\\frac{(m_1+m_2)a_1}{a_1+a_2}.\n$${#eq-masses-binary-system}\n\nThis is simple for a face-on binary but in general one has to also measure the inclination.\n\n_Determination of mass is a key result from binary star observations._\n\n\n# Binary systems classes\nThere are 4 main classes of binaries:\n\n- __Visual binaries__ – where with telescopes it is possible to resolve the two components\n- __Astrometric binaries__ – where we cannot resolve the individual stars but where we see a periodic wobble of the observed overall position\n- __Spectroscopic binaries__ – where the components are not resolvable but where Doppler shifts in their spectral lines reveal that there are two stars orbiting their centre of mass\n- __Eclipsing binaries__ – where we cannot resolve the individual stars but where we see a periodic brightening and dimming\n\n## Visual Binaries\n\nVisual binaries tend to be relatively near to us,\notherwise we could not resolve the components (remember the limitations of the parallax).\n\n- ~1000 visual binaries have been identified\n- long-term (many years) observations may be needed to establish the orbit\n- A good example is 70 Ophiuchi in @fig-70-ophiuchi: you need to be patient!\n\n![Example of visual binaries: 70 Ophiuchi.](img/VisualBinary.png){#fig-70-ophiuchi}\n\n## Astrometric binaries\n\nIf one of the stars is much brighter than the other, it might be possible to only see one of them.\nIn Chapter 1 we saw the case of a binary system: Sirius A and Sirius B (@fig-siriusAB), where Sirius B is much smaller than Sirius A.\nThe presence of a binary companion can be deduced from the apparent wobble of the star as it moves in its elliptical orbit. This situation is described as an __astrometric binary__.\n\nAn example of the motion of the Sirius binary system can be seen in @fig-sirius-astrometric.\n\nSirius can now be resolved visually, but it was initially detected as an astrometric binary. \n\n![Motion of the Sirius binary system in over 80 years.](img/sirius-astrometric.gif){#fig-sirius-astrometric}\n\n\n## Spectroscopic binaries\n\nIf the stars are too close together to resolve separately, we can still deduce whether the system is a binary by measuring spectral lines. Light from each star is doppler shifted as they move toward and away from us.\n\n- When a star is moving away from us, its light is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum (redshifted)\n- When a star is moving toward us, its light is shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum (blueshifted)\n\n![Schematic mechanism of doppler shift of spectral lines in spectroscopic binary.](img/SpectroscopicBinary.png){#fig-spectroscopic-binary}\n\nThe speed toward and away from us is reduced by the inclination of the orbital plane.\n$$\nv= v_{true} \\sin\\iota\n$${#eq-speed-doppler-inclination}\nwhere $\\iota$ is the __inclination angle__ between the orbital angular momentum vector and our line of sight.\n\nFor a spectral line with wavelength $\\lambda_0$ in the reference frame of the star, the doppler shift causes a shift of size $\\delta\\lambda$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}=\\frac{v}{c}\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the speed of the source toward or away from us along the line of sight.\n\nGiven the orbital period $P$, the true orbital velocity (for the star with index $i=1,2$) is\n$$\nv_{true,i}=\\frac{2\\pi a_i}{P},\n$${#eq-doppler-speed-true}\n\nso using @eq-speed-doppler-inclination we find the observed speeds for the two stars\n\n$$\nv_i = \\frac{2\\pi a_i \\sin\\iota}{P}.\n$${#eq-doppler-speed-observed}\n\nThe ratio between the speeds is then\n\n$$\n\\frac{v_1}{v_2}=\\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\\frac{m_2}{m_1},\n$${#eq-doppler-speeds-ratio}\nwhere in the last passage we used @eq-binary-orbital-com.\n\n- The $\\sin\\iota$ term from inclination cancels out in @eq-doppler-speeds-ratio!\n\n- In order to find the individual masses we need a way to measure $m_1+m_2$ as before.\n<!-- - Remember that $v_1=r_1\\omega$ and $v_2 = r_2\\omega$.\n- The angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi/P$ -->\n- The semi-major axis of the reduced system is $a=a_1+a_2$\n- Using @eq-doppler-speed-observed we can write\n$$\nv_1+v_2 = \\frac{2\\pi a \\sin\\iota}{P}\n$${#eq-total-speed-doppler}\n\n\n- Rearranging this for $a$ and using in the Kepler's third law (@eq-orbital-period) we find\n$$\nm_1+m_2 = \\frac{P}{2\\pi G}\\left(\\frac{v_1+v_2}{\\sin\\iota}\\right)^3.\n$${#eq-total-mass-doppler}\n\nUnfortunately, the $\\sin\\iota$ term doesn't cancel out here. If we don't precisely know the inclination then we have an uncertainty on the total mass.\n\nSo we have this limitation in our ability to deduce the individual masses.\n\n## Eclipsing binaries\n\n- Eclipsing binaries are a type of regular variable star\n- The presence of a binary can be deduced by measureing the light curve (magnitude over time)\n\n![Simulation of eclipsing binaries and their light curve in time.](img/eclipsing_binary.m4v)\n\n- The stars will eclipse each other only if we are viewing the system near edge-on ($\\iota \\approx 90^\\circ$)\n- So we can safely assume that we know the inclination\n- If we can also measure the doppler shift spectroscopically, then we can measure the individual masses using the spectroscopic method\n\n### Primary and secondary minima\n\n![Light curve in eclipsing binaries.](img/eclipse_hollow.svg){#fig-eclipsing-binaries}\n\nWhich eclipse will produce the greater reduction in the brightness (primary minimum)?\n\nWe can write the flux from each star as $$F_1=\\frac{4\\pi r_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi d^2}$$ $$F_2=\\frac{4\\pi r_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}{4\\pi d^2}$$. Assume for now that $r_1>r_2$, i.e. star 1 is bigger.\n\n- Consider the flux received:\n - When both stars are visible, $F_0 = F_1 + F_2$\n - When 2 moves behind 1, the flux is $F = F_1$\n - When 1 moves behind 2, the flux is\n \n\\begin{align}\nF' &= F_1\\left(1-\\frac{r_2^2}{r_1^2}\\right) + F_2 \\\\\n  & = \\frac{4\\pi r_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi d^2}\\left(1-\\frac{r_2^2}{r_1^2}\\right) + \\frac{4\\pi r_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}{4\\pi d^2} \\\\\n  & = \\frac{\\sigma}{d^2}\\left((r_1^2-r_2^2)T_1^4 + r_2^2T_2^4\\right) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\sigma}{d^2}\\left(r_1^2T_1^4 + r_2^2(T_2^4 - T_1^4)\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\nThe smaller star obscures a chunk of the larger, but it adds its own light. If it is higher temperature then it will be replaced by a brighter patch.\n\n- If $T_2>T_1$, then $F' > F_1$: secondary minimum - the cooler star moves behind the hotter\n- If $T_2<T_1$, then $F' < F_1$: primary minimum - the hotter star moves behind the cooler.\n\n![Light curve in eclipsing binaries. When the smaller star partially eclipses the bigger one, it replaces the eclipsed section with its brightness.](img/eclipse.svg){#fig-eclipsing-binaries2}\n\nIt can be shown that, if\n\n- $F_0$ is the flux when no eclipse is happening\n- $F_p$ is the primary eclipse flux\n- $F_s$ is the secondary eclipse flux,\n\nthen\n\n$$\n\\frac{F_0 - F_p}{F_0 - F_s} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^4,\n$${#eq-eclipsing-binaries-flux-ratio}\n\nwhere $T_1$ is the temperature of the larger star, and $T_2$ the smaller.\nFrom the measure of the fluxes we can find the ratio of the temperatures.\n\nSo in eclipsing, spectroscopic binaries we can get\n\n- the orbital period (from either light curve or spectroscopy)\n- speed of the stars in orbit (from spectroscopy), which can be used to find the size of the orbit\n- there is enough information to calculate the mass of the two stars.\n\nThe light curve gives us even more information, allowing us to compute the size of each star!\nThis can be done by measuring the time of the transit, and combining with the speed measured via doppler line shift.\n\n# Recap\n\n- Variable stars can be due to changes in the stars composition/dynamics or can be apparent, e.g. due to something eclipsing the star\n- Variable stars can be irregular (e.g. novae, T Tauri stars, supernovae) or regular (e.g. Cepheids)\n- The pulsation period in Cepheids is directly proportional to their luminosity\n- The period-luminosity relationship in Cepheids allows to easily find their distance\n- Most stars consist of binary systems\n- From the orbital analysis of binary systems we can find the individual masses of the two stars\n- Binary stars are divided in 4 classes: visual, astrometric, spectroscopic, eclipsing\n- Even when a binary system can not be resolved, we can guess that is the case by looking at other effects such as 'wobbling' of the star, doppler shift of the spectral lines and minima in light curves.\n\n",
