We will require some new physics to understand their behaviour and explain the observations.\n\n# Recap\n\nWe already know that stars form from collapse of gas clouds. What stops the collapse, eventually? Why doesn't the collapse continue down indefinitely, to a point?\n\n- Protostars release gravitational potential energy as heat (remember the KH timescale)\n- Main sequence stars and 'burning' stars, have nuclear reactions to release heat\n- This heat creates pressure in the interior that stops further collapse (hydrostatic equilibrium - see @fig-balance-he, @fig-hydroeq-pressure).\n\nBased on the ideal gas law\n$$\nP = nRT/V,\n$$\n\nwe need a finite temperature $T$ to create pressure.\nSince a star is losing heat into space, the heat energy must be continually replenished.\n\n![Thermal pressure balancing the gravitational force in the hydrostatic equilibrium condition.](img/balance.png){#fig-balance-he}\n\n![Hydrostatic equilibrium condition in a star. The gravity is balanced by the internal pressure. The higher the temperature, the higher the thermal pressure (the atoms in the core will have higher kinetic energy).](img/hydroeq-pressure.gif){#fig-hydroeq-pressure}\n\n- In protostars, contraction continues until fusion takes over\n- In burning stars, fusion of successively heavier elements takes place\n- But there is a limited amount of fuel in a star (see Iron Catastrophe in Chapter 6, @fig-iron-catastrophe).\n\nWhen the fuel runs out, the star will resume _contracting_, since there is no longer a thermal pressure to balance gravity.\n\n- So what is it that keeps White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars etc from collapsing?\n- And why is it that some stars _do_ collapse to black holes?\n\n## Low-mass stars ($\\sim 1 M_\\odot$)\n\nLow-mass stars fuse elements up to carbon. Thereafter, because stellar mass is low, core pressure due to self-gravity is not enough to cause sufficient temperature rise to begin fusion of heavier elements.\n\nOuter layers are expelled to form a planetary nebula and the carbon core collapses to form a __white dwarf__ (see Chapter 9).\n\n![The helix nebula, formed 10000 years ago and 700 light years away.](img/helix_neb.jpg){#fig-helix-nebula}\n\n\n## High-mass stars ($\\gtrsim 8M_\\odot$)\n\nStars continue fusion up to nickel and iron. Iron is the most tightly bound atomic nucleus -- no more energy available from fusion.\n \nStar also collapses, but since it is much more massive than a white-dwarf-progenitor, more gravitational energy can be released: much more violent event -- a __supernova__.\n\n![The Tycho supernova remnant (Seen in 1572, the 3rd/4th recorded in our galaxy).  A type Ia event.

The mass of the collapsing core is therefore much less than the _ZAMS_ mass.\n\nMost of the mass blown off into the interstellar medium can then be recycled to form other stars.\n\n![Evolution of stars depicted in different paths.

Kornmesser](img/evolution_of_stars.jpeg)\n\n# Supernova classification\n\nSupernovae are classified into different types depending on whether they show hydrogen in their spectrum, as we already anticipated in Chapter 3, when we talked about binaries.\n\n- __Type I__: have almost no hydrogen.\n- __Type II__: do show presence of hydrogen.\n\nType I supernovae are further classified in different categories based on the presence of other chemical elements (see @fig-supernovae-categorization-tree).\n\n![Schematic tree for the categorization of Supernovae.](img/sn_cat.png){#fig-supernovae-categorization-tree}\n\n- __Type Ia__ are believed to be the result of accreting white dwarfs in a binary system (see Chapter 3), being pushed over the mass limit and undergoing further nuclear fusion in a runaway reaction that destroys the star.\n  - Type Ia are found in all types of galaxies.\n\n- __Types Ib, Ic and II__ result from the collapse of high-mass stars straight to a neutron star or black hole.\n  - The lack of hydrogren in these categories indicates that the the stars involved have been stripped of their hydrogen envelopes.\n  - Types Ib,c are only found in spiral galaxies where there was recent star formation.\n  - This implies that Types Ib,c and due to massive short-lived stars.\n\nTypes Ia,b,c indicate that different mechanisms are at work.\n\n![Sketches of supernovae spectra from Carroll & Ostlie, data attributed to Thomas Matheson of National Optical Astronomy Observatory](img/SNspectra.gif){#fig-supernovae-spectra}\n\n\n# Supernova mechanism\n\nNeed $> 8M_\\odot$ for core collapse to allow carbon and oxygen burning.\n\n- An onion-like shell structure develops with fusion by-products (ashes), sinking down through the layers.\n- The final stage is silicon burning, which generates a host of nuclei centred around the 56Fe minimum of the binding energy curve (@fig-iron-catastrophe) - iron-56 is one of the most tightly bound nuclei\n- Since each stage is less energy efficient, they take shorter and shorter times to complete (for a 20$M_\\odot$ star, Hydrogen burning took 107 years; Silicon burning takes âˆ¼days).\n\n![Internal structure of a high-mass star, showing the shells of heavier elements toward the center.](img/onion.png){#fig-high-mass-star-onion}\n\n![Nuclear binding energy per nuclear particle, showing the iron at the bottom of the curve, so nor fission or fusion can happen after this is produced.](img/iron_catastrophe.png){#fig-iron-catastrophe}\n\n- Nuclear fuel is exhausted in the core. Radiated energy can no longer be replaced, so pressure falls.\n_Hydrostatic equilibrium is lost_, so core rapidly contracts ($\\sim 1/4$ second).\n    \n- Contraction releases gravitational potential energy, causing temperature to rise to $T\\sim~ 5\\times 10^{9}$K. High temperature allows _endothermic_ (heat absorbing) reactions.\n\n## Endothermic reactions\n\n### Photodisintegration\n\nEarlier _exothermic_ fusion reactions are reversed: photodisintegration.\n\nHigh energy photons like gamma photons can be absorbed, causing the nucleus to change to another species, emitting a subatomic particle (i.e. alpha particle, proton or neutron).\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n  ^{56}_{26}\\text{Fe}+\\gamma&\\rightarrow\n  13\\,^{4}_{2}\\text{He}+4\\,\\text{n}\\nonumber\\\\\n  ^{4}_{2}\\text{He}+\\gamma&\\rightarrow 2\\text{p}^{+}+2\\,\\text{n}\\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-photodisintegration}\n\n### Neutron capture\n\nNeutron caputre are other endothermic reactions that take place when an atomic nucleus collides with one or more neutrons, and merging they form an heavier nucleus.\n\nElements _heavier_ than iron can be created by neutron capture,e.g.\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n  ^{56}_{26}\\text{Fe}+128\\text{n}&\\rightarrow\n  ^{238}_{26}\\text{Fe}\\nonumber\\\\\n  ^{238}_{26}\\text{Fe}&\\rightarrow ^{238}_{92}\\text{U}+66\\text{e}^{-}+66\\bar{\\text{v}}_{\\text{e}}\\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-neutron-capture}\n\nProduces elements heavier than iron, e.g. copper, silver, gold, platinum, bismuth, thorium, uranium, etc.\n\n### Electron capture\n\nEndothermic reactions absorb $\\sim 2/3$ of gravitational energy released by initial collapse $\\rightarrow$ further contraction $\\rightarrow$ further temperature rise.\n  \nCore temperature reaches $\\sim 10^{10}$K. Hot enough for inverse beta decay (reverse of normal beta decay of radioactive nuclei).\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n  \\text{p}^{+}+\\text{e}^{-}&\\rightarrow\n  \\text{n}+\\text{v}_{\\text{e}}\\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-electron-capture}\n\nThis process is highly endothermic. \nA proton and an electron ($\\text{p}^{+}$ and $\\text{e}^{-}$) become one neutron and emit a neutrino. \nSince neutrinos are very weakly interacting, they easily escape to space.\n\nConsequence: extreme pressure drop in core.\nThe core separates from the outer envelope and goes into __free-fall__, collapsing at $\\sim 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} (\\sim 1/3 c).$\n\n## Collapse\n\n- Core collapses to radius of $\\sim 20$ km. Consists of closely-packed neutrons at $\\sim 3\\times$ nuclear densities ($\\sim 10^{9}$ tonnes cm$^{-3}$).\n- At this point, core stiffens due to __degeneracy pressure__ (see Chapter 8) and abruptly halts collapse. Degenerate core rebounds slightly, sending shock wave back up through in-falling material.\n- Shock wave initiates further endothermic reactions and loses energy, but is boosted by huge flux of neutrinos emanating from core.\nFurther in-falling material continues to strike degenerate core and rebound $\\sim$ elastically.\n\n## Remnant\n\nBouncing material and enormous neutrino flux blows outer layers of star off into space, forming a supernova remnant.\n\n# An example: The Crab Nebula\n\n![Crab Nebula.](img/crab.jpg){#fig-crab-nebula2}\n\n<!-- <div style=\"right_panel\"> -->\n- The Crab Nebula is ${\\sim}6500$ light years away.\n- Diameter of $\\sim 11$ light years.\n- Current expansion velocity $\\sim 1500$ km s$^{-1}$, i.e. $\\sim 0.5\\%$ of speed of light.\n- This is the 2nd recorded observed supernova. Seen on July 4th 1054 by\na court astrologer during China's Sung dynasty.\n- Initially visible during the day!\n\n# Why do SN remnants expand so quickly?\n\n![Representation of density blocks of material encountered by shock waves as they travel toward the outer part of the star.](img/density.svg)\n\nAs the shock wave travels out through stellar envelope, carrying energy and momentum, it encounters material of ever decreasing density.\n\n![Blocks of smaller mass per unit area are encountered by shock waves as they propagate.](img/volume.svg)\n\nEnergy and momentum is conserved. __Shock wave__ passing into lower density region transmits momentum to a progressively lower mass of material per unit surface area of the wave.\n\nFrom the definition of momentum $p=mv,$ we know that roughly the same $p$ and smaller $m$ results in larger $v$. Low-density outer layers attain huge expulsion velocity.\n\n# Energy Budget and Luminosity\n\n![Supernova SN1994D.](img/SN1994D.jpg){#fig-sn1994d}\n\nObservationally, supernovae brighten rapidly to $\\sim10^{9}\\,L_{\\odot}$ in about 10 days, then slowly dim over about 100 days, i.e. they may briefly outshine their entire host galaxy.\n\nEnergy source is the _release of gravitational potential energy_ by the contraction of the core.\n  \n![Core contraction from a core of radius $R_0$ to a neutron star of radius $R_{NS}$.](img/contraction.jpg){#fig-core-contraction}\n\nGravitational potential energy of a uniform sphere is roughly\n$$\nE_G=-\\frac{GM^{2}}{r}.\n$$\nSo the energy released by contraction, from the core initially having radius $r_1$ (when the contraction starts, assuming no more mass is lost) to the neutron star of radius $r_2$, is roughly\n$$\n\\Delta E\\approx\\left(\\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{1}}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{2}}\\right).\n$$\nSince $r_{1}\\gg r_{2}$\n$$\n\\Delta E\\approx \\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{2}}\n$${#eq-deltae-contraction}\n\n- Using typical __neutron star__ values of $M=1.4M_{\\odot}$ and $r_{2}=20$km, we find energy released $E\\approx 10^{46}$ J.\n- This is equivalent to $L_{\\odot}$ emitted continuously for $10^{20}$ seconds, or $\\sim 100$ times the Sun's total energy production over its Main Sequence lifetime, but in only $\\sim 1/4$ second!\n\n__Where does all this energy go?__\n\n- About $2/3$ of released energy is reabsorbed in endothermic reactions.\n- Most of remaining $1/3$ is released as neutrinos - about $10^{57}$ of them.\n- About $1\\%$ goes into kinetic energy of the _ejecta_.\n- About $1\\%$ goes into photons, with about $0.01\\%$ as a visible flash.\n\n- Supernovae produce __cosmic rays__ (extremely high energy particles, mostly protons but also some electrons and heavier nuclei).\n- Supernovae distribute heavier elements into space, which are then incorporated into new stars and planets. Some of the material in the human body was \"cooked\" in supernovae.\n\n\n## Supernovae and the interstellar medium\n\n- The supernova shock wave can disrupt interstellar gas clouds, perturbing their equilibrium and causing collapse and fragmentation -- new stars form, thus completing the cycle of stellar life.\n- With roughly 2 supernovae per galaxy per 100 years, and about $10^{11}$ galaxies in the universe, there are on average about 50 supernovae per second!\n\n![Supernova 1987A: it was the last supernova in our galaxy (actually in LMC satellite galaxy)](img/SN1987A2.jpg){#fig-sn1987a}\n\n",
