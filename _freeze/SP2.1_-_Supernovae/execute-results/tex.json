We will require some new physics to understand their behaviour and explain the observations.\n\n## Recap\n\nWe already know that star form from collapse of gas clouds. Why doesn't the collapse continue down to a point?\n\n- Protostars release gravitational potential energy as heat\n- Main sequence stars and 'burning' stars, have nuclear reactions to release heat\n- This heat creates pressure in the interior that stops further collapse (hydrostatic equilibrium)\n\n$$P = nRT/V $$\n\nWe need a finite temperature $T$ to create pressure.\nSince a star is losing heat into space, the heat energy must be continually replenished.\n\n<img src=\"img/balance.png\" class=\"right_panel\">\n\n- In protostars, contraction continues until fusion takes over\n- In burning stars, fusion of successively heavier elements takes place\n- But there is a limited amount of fuel in a star (see Iron Catastrophe)\n\n![Iron Catastrophe](img/iron_catastrophe.png){#fig-iron-catastrophe}\n\nWhen the fuel runs out, the star will resume _contracting_, since there is no longer a thermal pressure to balance gravity.\n\n- So what is it that keeps White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars etc from collapsing?\n- And why is it that some stars _do_ collapse to black holes?\n\n## Low-mass stars ($\\sim 1 M_\\odot$)\n\n![The helix nebula, formed 10000 years ago and 700 light years away.](img/helix_neb.jpg){#fig-helix-nebula}\n\n\nStars fuse elements up to carbon. Thereafter, because stellar mass is low, core pressure due to self-gravity is not enough to cause sufficient temperature rise to begin fusion of heavier elements.\n\nCarbon core collapses to form a white dwarf (see later), outer layers are expelled to form a planetary nebula.\n\n\n## High-mass stars ($\\gtrsim 8M_\\odot$)\n\n<img src=\"img/tycho_nova.jpg\" class=\"right_panel\">\n\n_The Tycho supernova remnant (Seen in 1572, the 3rd/4th\nrecorded in our galaxy).  A type Ia event. (185, 1006, 1054, 1572, 1604,\n1987*)_\n\n Stars continue fusion up to nickel and iron. Iron is\n the most tightly bound atomic nucleus -- no more energy available\n from fusion.\n \n Star also collapses, but since it is much more\n massive than a white-dwarf-progenitor, more gravitational energy\n can be released: much more violent event - a __supernova__.\n\n## Fates of stars\n\n| ZAMS mass | Collapsing mass | Fate |\n|-----------|-----------------|------|\n| $\\lesssim 8\\,M_\\odot$ | $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ | white dwarf |\n| $8 - 25 M_\\odot$ | 1.4 - 3 $M_\\odot$ | Neutron Star |\n| $\\gtrsim 25 M_\\odot$ | $\\gtrsim 3 M_\\odot$ | Black Hole |\n\n\nIn very late stages of stellar evolution, much of the\n  star's initial mass (_Zero Age Main Sequence Mass_) is blown off as\n  the outer layers are shed into space (_radiation pressure_). The mass of the collapsing\n  core is therefore much less than the _ZAMS_ mass.\n\n## Supernova classification\n\nSupernovae are classified into different types depending on whether they show hydrogen in their spectrum. Type I have almost no hydrogen, Type II do show presence of hydrogen.\n\n- Type Ia are believed to be the result of accreting white dwarfs being pushed over the mass limit and undergoing further nuclear fusion in a runaway reaction that destroys the star.\n- Types Ib, Ic and II result from the collapse of high-mass stars straight to a neutron star or black hole.\n\n<img src=\"img/SNspectra.gif\" class=\"left_panel\">\n<img src=\"img/sn_cat.png\" class=\"right_panel\">\n\nThe lack of hydrogren indicates that the the stars involved have been stripped of their hydrogen envelopes.\n\n- Types Ia,b,c indicate that different mechanisms are at work.\n- Type Ia are found in all types of galaxies.\n- Types Ib,c are only found in spiral galaxies where there was recent star formation.\n- This implies that Types Ib,c and due to massive short-lived stars.\n\n## Supernova mechanism\n\n<img src=\"img/onion.png\" class=\"right_panel\">\n\nNeed $> 8M_\\odot$ for core collapse to allow carbon and oxygen burning.\n- An onion-like shell structure develops with fusion by-products (ashes)\nsinking down through the layers.\n- The final stage is silicon\nburning which generates a\nhost of nuclei centred around\nthe 56Fe minimum of the 26\nbinding energy curve.\n- Since each stage is less energy efficient, they take shorter and shorter times to complete (for a 20M⊙ star, Hydogen burning took 107 years; Silicon burning takes\n∼days).\n\n- Nuclear fuel is exhausted in the core. Radiated energy can no\n    longer be replaced, so pressure falls.\n    _Hydrostatic equilibrium is\n    lost_, so core rapidly contracts ($\\sim 1/4$ second).\n    \n- Contraction releases gravitational potential energy, causing\n    temperature to rise to $T\\sim~ 5\\times 10^{9}$K. High temperature\n    allows _endothermic_ (heat absorbing) reactions.\n\n## Photodisintegration\n\n  Earlier _exothermic_ fusion reactions are reversed:\n  photodisintegration.\n  \\begin{align}\n    ^{56}_{26}\\text{Fe}+\\gamma&\\rightarrow\n    13\\,^{4}_{2}\\text{He}+4\\,\\text{n}\\nonumber\\\\\n    ^{4}_{2}\\text{He}+\\gamma&\\rightarrow 2\\text{p}^{+}+2\\,\\text{n}\\nonumber\n  \\end{align}\n\n## Neutron capture\n\n  Endothermic reactions also create elements _heavier_ than iron by\n  neutron capture,e.g.\n  \\begin{align}\n    ^{56}_{26}\\text{Fe}+128\\text{n}&\\rightarrow\n    ^{238}_{26}\\text{Fe}\\nonumber\\\\\n    ^{238}_{26}\\text{Fe}&\\rightarrow ^{238}_{92}\\text{U}+66\\text{e}^{-}+66\\bar{\\text{v}}_{\\text{e}}\\nonumber\n  \\end{align}\n  Produces elements heavier than iron, e.g. copper, silver, gold,\n  platinum, bismuth, thorium, uranium, etc.\n\n## Electron capture\n\n  Endothermic reactions absorb $\\sim 2/3$ of gravitational energy\n  released by initial collapse $\\rightarrow$ further contraction\n  $\\rightarrow$ further temperature rise.\n  \n  Core temperature\n  reaches $\\sim 10^{10}$K. Hot enough for inverse beta decay (reverse\n  of normal beta decay of radioactive nuclei).\n  \\begin{align}\n    \\text{p}^{+}+\\text{e}^{-}&\\rightarrow\n    \\text{n}+\\text{v}_{\\text{e}}\\nonumber\n  \\end{align}\n  \n  This process is highly endothermic. Also, since neutrinos are very\n  weakly interacting, they easily escape to space: 2 particles\n  ($\\text{p}^{+}$ and $\\text{e}^{-}$) become one\n  neutron. Consequence: {\\bf extreme pressure drop in core}. Core separates\n  from the outer envelope and goes into __free-fall__, collapsing at $\\sim\n  10^{5}\\,\\text{km}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ ($\\sim 1/3 c$).\n\n## Collapse\n\n- Core collapses to radius of $\\sim 20$ km. Consists of closely-packed\n    neutrons at $\\sim 3\\times$ nuclear densities ($\\sim 10^{9}$ tonnes\n    cm$^{-3}$).\n- At this point, core stiffens due to __degeneracy\n    pressure__ (see later) and abruptly halts collapse. Degenerate core rebounds\n    slightly, sending shock wave back up through in-falling\n    material.\n- Shock wave initiates further endothermic reactions and loses energy,\n    but is boosted by huge flux of neutrinos emanating from core.\n    Further in-falling material continues to strike degenerate core and\n    rebound $\\sim$ elastically.\n\n## Remnant\n\n Bouncing material and enormous neutrino flux blows outer layers of star off\ninto space, forming a supernova remnant.\n\n## The Crab Nebula\n\n<img src=\"img/crab_nebula.jpg\" class=\"left_panel\">\n\n<div style=\"right_panel\">\n- ${\\sim}6500$ light years away.\n<br />\n- Diameter of $\\sim 11$ light years.\n<br />\n- Current expansion velocity $\\sim\n      1500$ km s$^{-1}$, i.e. $\\sim 0.5\\%$ of speed of light.\n<br />\n- This is the 2nd recorded observed supernova. Seen on July 4th 1054 by\na court astrologer during China's Sung dynasty.\n<br />\n- Initially visible during the day!\n</div>\n\n## Why do SN remnants expand so quickly?\n\n<img src=\"img/density.svg\" class=\"right_panel\">\n\n As the shock wave travels out through stellar envelope, carrying energy\n    and momentum, it encounters material of ever decreasing density.\n\n<img src=\"img/volume.svg\" class=\"right_panel\">\n\nEnergy and momentum is conserved. __Shock wave__ passing\n    into lower density region transmits momentum to a progressively\n    lower mass of material per unit surface area of the wave.\n    \n$$p=mv$$\n\nRoughly same $p$ and smaller $m$ results in larger\n    $v$. Low-density outer layers attain huge expulsion velocity.\n\n## Energy Budget\n\n    \n<img src=\"img/SN1994D.jpg\" class=\"right_panel\">\n\nObservationally, supernovae brighten rapidly to $\\sim\n    10^{9}\\,L_{\\odot}$ in about 10 days, then slowly dim over about\n    100 days, i.e. they may briefly outshine their entire host galaxy.\n\n## Luminosity\n\n Energy source is the _release of gravitational potential energy_ by\n  the contraction of the core.\n  \n![contraction](img/contraction.jpg)\n\nGravitational potential energy of a uniform sphere is roughly\n  \\begin{equation}\n    E=-\\frac{GM^{2}}{r}\\nonumber\n  \\end{equation}\n  So energy released by contraction is roughly\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\Delta\n    E\\approx\\left(\\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{1}}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{2}}\\right)\\nonumber\n    \\end{equation}\n  and since $r_{1}\\gg r_{2}$\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\Delta\n    E\\approx \\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{2}}\\nonumber\n  \\end{equation}\n\n- Using typical __neutron star__ values of $M=1.4M_{\\odot}$ and $r_{2}=20$km, we find energy released $E\\approx 10^{46}$ J.\n- This is equivalent to $L_{\\odot}$ emitted continuously for $10^{20}$ seconds, or $\\sim 100$ times the Sun's total energy production over its Main Sequence lifetime, but in only $\\sim 1/4$ second!\n- About $2/3$ of released energy is reabsorbed in endothermic reactions.\n- Most of remaining $1/3$ is released as neutrinos - about $10^{57}$ of them.\n- About $1\\%$ goes into kinetic energy of the _ejecta_.\n- About $1\\%$ goes into photons, with about $0.01\\%$ as a visible flash.\n\n- Supernovae produce __cosmic rays__ (extremely high energy particles, mostly protons but also some electrons and heavier nuclei).\n- Supernovae distribute heavier elements into space, which are    then incorporated into new stars and planets. Some of the material    in the human body was ``cooked'' in supernovae.\n\n- The supernova shock wave can disrupt interstellar gas clouds, perturbing their equilibrium and causing collapse and fragmentation -- new stars form, thus completing the cycle of stellar life.\n- With roughly 2 supernovae per galaxy per 100 years, and about $10^{11}$ galaxies in the universe, there are on average about 50    supernovae per second!\n\n![SN1987A](img/SN1987A2.jpg)\n\nSupernova 1987A was the last supernova in our galaxy (actually in LMC satellite galaxy)\n\n",
