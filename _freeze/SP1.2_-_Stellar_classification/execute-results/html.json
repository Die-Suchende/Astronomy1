Let's see what we can expect to find when we look at real stars.\n\nStars have very wide ranges of luminosity, so it will be helpful to work with the logarithm of @eq-total-luminosity.\n\n\\begin{align}\nL &= 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4 \\\\\n\\log_{10} L &= \\log_{10}(4\\pi\\sigma) + 2\\log_{10}(R) + 4\\log_{10}T\n\\end{align}\n\nWe can plot a graph of $y=\\log_{10} L$ against $x=-\\log_{10} T$ for some value of $R,$ and we should get a straight line.\n\nNote that here $x$ has a negative sign here because in the $x$-axis of @fig-luminosity-temperature-fixedr-plot, the temperature decreases from right to left.\nWe will see shortly why we use this convention.\n\n::: {.cell slideshow='{\"slide_type\":\"subslide\"}' execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy import linspace, logspace, log10, pi\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nplt.figure(dpi=300)\nsigma = 5.671e-8\nfor r in [1e10, 5e9, 1e9, 5e8]: # radius, m\n    T=logspace(log10(1000),log10(20000),100)\n    L=4.0*pi*sigma*r**2*T**4\n    #L = 10**(log10(4.0*pi*sigma) + 2*log10(r) + 4*log10(T))\n    plt.loglog(T,L, label=f'R={r:3.0e} m')\n    #plt.plot(-log10(T), log10(L), label=f'r={r:3.0e} m')\n    \nplt.xlim(plt.xlim()[::-1])\nplt.xlabel('$T$ [K]')\nplt.ylabel('$L$ [W]')\nplt.title('Luminosity - temperature')\nplt.grid(True,which='both',alpha=0.4)\nplt.legend();\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Log-log plot of luminosity vs temperature for different values of the radius R.](SP1.2_-_Stellar_classification_files/figure-html/fig-luminosity-temperature-fixedr-plot-output-1.png){#fig-luminosity-temperature-fixedr-plot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that for each radius $R$ there is a straight line relationship when plotted on logarithmic axes.\n\nLower radii lie on lines toward the bottom of the plot.\n\nWhat can we tell from this plot, and from the formula for the total luminosity relating temperature and radius?\n\n- If two stars have the same radius (lie on the same coloured line in @fig-luminosity-temperature-fixedr-plot), then the hotter one will have higher luminosity (the temperature increases from left to right in the plot)\n- If two stars have the same temperature (lie on the same line parallel to the y axis), then the larger one must be more luminous\n- If two stars have the same luminosity (lie on the same line parallel to the x axis), then the smaller one is hotter.\n\nWe know also that stars are not static, they change and evolve with time. This means that their luminosity, radius and temperature of a star are not always the same. This means that a star will move across the Luminosity-Temperature plot of @fig-luminosity-temperature-fixedr-plot during its lifetime.\n\n<!-- ```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"800\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://starinabox.lco.global/#\" title=\"Star in a box simulator\"></iframe>\n``` -->\n\nSo where do stars fall on this plot? And how do they move around it during their lifetime?\n\n# The Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram\nTwo astronomers independently devised ways to represent catalogued stars on a diagram, based on their observed properties:\n\n- Ejnar HERTZSPRUNG (Denmark 1873 – 1967)\n- Henry Norris RUSSELL (USA, 1877 – 1957)\n\nThey constructed the plot now known as a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, universally called an __H-R diagram__ for short.\n\n![H-R diagram: Luminosity vs Temperature](img/HR_LT_basic.png){#fig-HR-luminosity-temperature}\n\n- Stars are found to cluster in distinct areas of the HR diagram\n- 80% to 90% of stars lie on a strip called the __Main Sequence__\n- There are other branches of stars: __White Dwarfs, Giants and Supergiants__\n- Remember that the temperature (x-axis) decreases as we go from left to right\n- We use the H-R diagram to understand stellar evolution\n\n_Why are we justified in giving the names \"dwarfs\" and \"giants\" to these classes?_\n\n## A real HR diagram\n\n![Gaia HR diagram. Image credit: Gaia Collaboration, _Observational Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams_, A&A 616 (2018)](img/HR_Gaia.png){#fig-gaia-HR-diagram}\n\n- Over 1.3 billion stars contained in Gaia Data Release 2\n- Note the colour scale is non-linear - white/yellow regions are more populated\n- Axes are colour index ($G_{BP} - G_{RP}$, Blue - Red magnitude, i.e. blue stars on the left, redder stars on the right) vs absolute magnitude ($M_G$): We know these are related to temperature and luminosity\n- We can see the main sequence, giants, and white dwarfs clearly\n- There are other less populated clusters too: we will see what they mean for stellar evolution\n\nHere is an annotated HR diagram showing temperature and luminosity along with magnitude and colour index.\n\n![H-R diagram showing temperature and luminosity along with magnitude and colour index.](img/HR_L_CI.png){#fig-HR-diagram-LT-CM}\n\n## Interpretation of the HR diagram\n\n- Only certain combinations of luminosity and temperature are allowed\n- The HR diagram shows stars with a wide range of ages\n- Most stars sit on the main sequence\n- Let's assume that stars move around on the HR diagram, from one class to another, as they evolve\n\nWhat does this tell us?\n\n- We are looking at a snapshot of the stellar population\n- Stars follow 'tracks' on the HR diagram over their lifetime\n- Clusters in the HR diagram are stars at similar stages of their lives\n- The number of stars in each part of the diagram is proportional to the duration of that stage of their evolution\n\n# The Main Sequence\n\n- The main sequence is the most populated part of the HR diagram (80-90% of stars). We can deduce that stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence.\n- The main sequence has most variation from top-left to bottom-right, along a line of roughly constant radius. (This is not exact as there is a range of stellar radii)\n- The top-left blue stars are hotter and more luminous, and therefore require more power\n- The bottom-right red stars are much dimmer and cooler\n- Hot blue stars are using up their fuel much more quickly\n- We will see later the implications for their evolution\n\n## The main sequence: limits\n\nThere are two cut-offs to the main sequence:\n\n- At the top: extremely luminous stars blow off material from their surface through _radiation pressure_, naturally limiting their mass\n- At the bottom: very cool red stars are not hot enough to begin nuclear reactions: the temperature in their core is too low\n\nWe can suppose that luminous blue stars have high mass and dim red stars low mass, and that this is the main determining factor of where a star appears on the main sequence. (We will check this theoretically later.)\n\n## The main sequence: mass and luminosity\n\n- Later we will see that luminosity is increased with higher mass: $L\\propto M^\\alpha.$\n\nWe can estimate the time a star spends on the main sequence with\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Lifetime} = \\frac{\\mathrm{energy\\ available}}{\\mathrm{luminosity}} \\propto \\frac{M}{M^\\alpha}\n\\end{align}\n$${#eq-lifetime-ms}\n\n__The most massive stars spend the least amount of time on the main sequence__\n\n## Giants and Supergiants\n\nGiants and supergiants sit above the main sequence in the top-right\n\n- Large $L$ but low $T$, so $r$ must be very large: 'giants'\n- This area is less populated than the main sequence, so stars spend less of their lives in this phase\n- We will see that they reach this stage of their life after they spend time on the main sequence\n- We need to explain what causes the radius of the star to increase!\n\n# White dwarfs\n\n- White dwarfs sit at the bottom-left of the HR diagram\n- Below the main sequence, so radius smaller: 'dwarfs'\n- $L\\sim 0.01 L_\\odot$, none visible to the naked eye\n- $T\\sim 16000\\,$K.\n- $R\\sim R_\\odot /70$ (similar size to the Earth)\n- We need to explain why the radius is so small!\n- How do they get to be so hot?\n\nWe need Stellar Evolution to explain all this!\n\n# Classification schemes\n\nWe have seen that on the main sequence, there are a range of star colours. We can use this to classify them.\n\n- Hot stars appear blue, cool stars appear red\n- We can quantify this by measuring the flux (magnitude) in different wavelength bands\n- The Photometric system divides the spectrum into commonly used bands\n- A common convention is the UBVRI system:\n   - __U__-band (ultraviolet): centred on 350 nm\n   - __B__-band (blue) : centred on 440 nm\n   - __V__-band (visible): centred on 550 nm\n   - __R__-band (red): centred around 600 nm\n   - __I__-band (near-infrared): around 800 nm\n\nFilters are placed over the telescope to select a band. A photograph of a set of filters is shown in @fig-ubvri-filters.\n\n![UBVRI filters.](img/UBVRI_filters.jpg){#fig-ubvri-filters}\n\nDifferent instruments have slightly different filters from different manufacturers. An example is shown in @fig-ubvri.\n\n![UBVRI](img/UBVRI.jpeg){#fig-ubvri}\n\nYou don't have to memorise this for the course.\n\nIn the previous chapter we saw that black bodies emit at all wavelengths but the amount of light emitted at each wavelength is not the same. It depends on the temperature of the black body, which is related to the position of the peak and therefore to the colour of the black body (see @fig-bb-spectrum-colours).\n\nYou can now see how observation through filters give us different information on the flux observed at different wavelength windows.\n\n![Emission spectra of black bodies at different temperatures, with the peaks at different wavelengths of the visible part of the light spectrum.](img/spectrum_bb.jpeg){#fig-bb-spectrum-colours}\n\n## Colour Index\n\n- The colour index is the numerical difference in magnitudes between measurements made in two wavelength bands\n- To measure the index, measurements are made successively through two different filters, such as U and B, or B and V to give the usual colour indices, e.g.\n- __B - V__  Difference between magnitude in Blue and Visible bands\n- __V - I__  Difference between magnitude in Visible and Near-Infrared bands\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nNote that the bolometric luminosity is not measured by any of the filters!\n In practice, usually the visual magnitude is measured and then a correction (the bolometric correction) is applied to it, to find the bolometric magnitude. This is generally important when doing physics calculations using the total Luminosity, as the correction depends on the temperature of the star.\n For this course we will ignore this, and you can assume that luminosity problems will be set with the bolometric magnitude. Howewver, in historical sources, the V-band magnitude is used.\n:::\n\n### Colour Index Examples\n\nThe Sun, which appears yellowish, has\n\n- U band apparent magnitude -25.96\n- B band apparent magnitude -26.09\n- V band apparent magnitude - 26.74\n- So the B-V colour index for the Sun is +0.65\n\n![Orion Nebula, containing Rigel.](img/Rigel.png){#fig-orion-nebula}\n\n<!-- <img style=\"float: right; max-height: 500px; position:relative;\" src=\"img/Rigel.png\"> -->\n\n\nRigel which appears bluish has\n\n- B band apparent magnitude 0.09\n- V band apparent magnitude 0.12\n- So the B-V colour index for Rigel is -0.03\n\n- So the smaller the colour index (i.e lower position on a number scale that ranges from positive, through zero, into negative numbers), the more blue (and hotter) the star\n- From the Planck curve you would think that any given star surface temperature T would have automatically determined values of the colour indices\n- However real stars are a bit more complicated than ideal black bodies...\n\n### Colour Index and the HR diagram\n\n- Colour Index was the original quantity plotted along the x-axis in the HR-diagram\n- This is why $\\log_{10}T$ decreases going from left to right!\n- The exact relationship between Colour Index and effective temperature is not simple, but we can state it approximately as :\n\n$$\nB-V \\approx \\frac{7000\\, \\mathrm{K}}{T} - 0.56\n$$\n\n# Light spectra\n\nBlack bodies emit a __continuous spectrum__: this means that light is emitted at all wavelengths. If this goes through a prism or diffraction grating, we are able to see the 'rainbow' pattern where light is divided into all its components (see @fig-continuous-emission-absorption-spectra).\nWe will come back to explaining the emission and absorption spectra in this figure shortly.\n\n![Emission and Absoption spectra](img/EmissionAbsorption.png){#fig-continuous-emission-absorption-spectra}\n\n## Light from the Sun\n\nWe anticipated that stars are not really black bodies, and in the previous chapter we saw that the plot of the Solar irradiance (@fig-solar-irradiance) presents some features such as lines that we still have to explain.\n\nLet's look at the Solar spectrum in @fig-solar-spectrum.\n\n![The solar spectrum](img/solarspectrum_noao.jpg){#fig-solar-spectrum}\n\n__What do we see?__\n\n- Dark absorption lines, superimposed on the expected continuous spectrum\n- The lines are fingerprints of the elements present in the Sun's atmosphere\n\n@fig-xkcd-suns-spectrum shows a comic version of Sun's spectrum, highlighting the relationship between the dark lines and the elements in the Sun's atmosphere.\n\n![Comic version of the Sun's spectrum. Source: [XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/solar_spectrum.png).](img/xkcd_solar_spectrum.png){#fig-xkcd-suns-spectrum}\n\n## Light from the Sun – early observations\nIn 1835 a French philosopher, Auguste Comte, wrote the following about the stars: “We see how we may determine their forms, their distances, their bulk, their motions, but _we can never know anything of their chemical or mineralogical structure_.”\n\n- 1802: Wollaston discovered dark lines superimposed on a continuous spectrum by watching sunlight through a prism\n- 1814: Fraunhofer catalogued 475 of these lines. He observed that two of the missing yellow lines of the Solar spectrum had _exactly_ the same wavelength as the two yellow lines emitted by sodium (salt) when sprinkled on a flame.\n- Wollaston and Fraunhofer showed that the continuum light from the Sun was absorbed at discrete wavelengths.\n\nTo understand this we need to answer one of our first questions: what are the stars made of?\n\n- Stars are mainly hydrogen\n- Hydrogen emits light only at particular __emission lines__ when excited in the laboratory (see, for example, @fig-balmer-series)\n- So why do we see a continuous spectrum?\n- Why do we see absorption lines in the spectrum of stars?\n- Why do we see emission lines from regions of the sky nears stars? (Emission nebulae)\n\n\n## Kirchoff's Laws of Spectroscopy\n\nIn 1860 Kirchhoff and Bunsen published rules for the production of spectral lines, summed up in @fig-kirchhoffs-laws.\n\nGustav Kirchhoff studied the three types of spectra seen under different conditions and, in 1860, derived laws to explain them.\n\n- __1.__ A hot and opaque solid, liquid or highly compressed gas emits a continuous blackbody spectrum (as named by Kirchhoff) with no spectral lines \n- __2.__ A hot, transparent gas, illuminated by a continuum source, produces a spectrum of bright emission lines\n- __3.__ If a continuous spectrum passes through a transparent gas at a lower temperature, the cooler gas will absorb at characteristic wavelengths resulting in dark absorption lines\n\nFor 2 and 3, the number and colours of the lines depends on the elements present in the gas.\n\n- Kirchhoff produced these laws without knowing about the energy levels in atoms!\n\n![A scheme of Kirchhoff's laws of spectroscopy.](img/kirchhoffs_laws.jpeg){#fig-kirchhoffs-laws}\n\n\n## Ideal and real spectra\n\n\nWe can now answer the questions about why we get absorption of emission lines.\n\n- The surface of the star is assumed to radiate as a blackbody.\n- Absorption spectral lines are due to the atoms in the atmosphere above the surface (see @fig-ideal-real-spectrum)\n- Spectra of some objects (e.g. galaxies) can also contain emission spectral lines (see @fig-emission-spectrum-galaxy).\nSpectroscopy gives us information about the chemical composition of the stars, their atmosphere, radius, temperature, nature, motion…\n\n![Comparison between an ideal blackbody spectrum and a real stellar spectrum observed.

The gravity is balanced by the internal pressure. The higher the temperature, the higher the thermal pressure (the atoms in the core will have higher kinetic energy).](img/hydroeq-pressure.gif){#fig-hydroeq-pressure}\n\n_Why are more massive stars on the main sequence more luminous?_\n\nThe nuclear reaction rate in a star is very sensitive to the core temperature.\nEven a slight increase in temperature makes the nuclear reactions occur at a MUCH higher rate.\nSo a slight increase in the mass of the star produces a large increase in the star’s luminosity.\n\n\n## Mass-Luminosity Relation – implication\n\n- The luminosity is a very strong function of mass: $3.0\\le\\alpha\\le3.5$ is quite big.\n- There are great implications for how long stars live on the Main Sequence\n- Massive stars have very short lifetimes because they burn up their fuel more quickly than less massive stars\n\nWe will return to this when we study stellar evolution.\n\n# Recap\n\n- Stars can be mapped on the HR diagram based on their colour/temperature/spectral class vs magnitude/luminosity\n- Stars are mostly distributed on the main sequence (they spend most of their lifetime there), but other classes are giants and white dwarfs.\n- The stars at the top left of the main sequence in the HR diagram are blue, hotter, more luminous and more massive than the ones red stars at the bottom right\n- Kirchhoff’s laws describe how continuous, emission and absorption spectra are produced\n- Spectral types are classifies based on their temperature and chemical composition according to the ‘OBAFGKM’ Harvard spectral classification\n- Stars on the main sequence have a mass-luminosity relationship\n\n",
