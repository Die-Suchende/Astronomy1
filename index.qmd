# Preface {.unnumbered}
This is a set of Stellar Physics notes for the Astronomy 1 course at the University of Glasgow (2023/2024).

Recommended textbook for this course:

- "An introduction to Modern Astrophysics", Carroll & Ostlie, 2nd edition

You can access the eBook from the UofG Library at [this link](https://go.exlibris.link/gy312v1j).

The slides are for guidance only and are not as complete as the notes. You are supposed to read the notes, which contain interacting material, and to complement them with your own notes, taken during the lectures. Complementing these with the book is not necessary but can be useful for clarifications.


<!-- # Introduction

Astronomy is a _observational_ science. We cannot bring a star down to Earth to study it in the laboratory. Unlike other branches of Physics, we cannot experiment directly on stars and what happens in the universe is beyond our control, but we can use our knowledge of Physics to make predictions and we can use observations to validate our theories. This can allow us to answer many questions about the stars. Some of these questions date back to the most ancient times, and through history have inspired philosophers and scientists to develop our understanding of the cosmos. This interplay between Astronomy and Physics is today called _Astrophysics_, which has grown to encompass phenomena from planets to galaxies to the evolution of the universe.


**Astrophysics is very multidisciplinary**

Astrophysics is very multidisciplinary because of 'several effects' that come into play in the physics of stars, galaxies, the universe... it is an 'arena' of different fields of physics (but also mathematics and chemistry), spanning across classical mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, statistics, atomic and molecular physics, plasma physics, quantum mechanics and more (the list above and in the picture is not exhaustive)!
In this course you will see how some of these fields play a role in the physics of stars. -->
