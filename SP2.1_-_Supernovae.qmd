-----------

In this second part of this course we will be looking at post-main-sequence evolution.
This means we will be looking at the end states of stellar evolution: white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.
Unlike main sequence stars we have been looking at so far, these objects are _not_ powered by nuclear fusion. We will require some new physics to understand their behaviour and explain the observations.

# Recap

We already know that stars form from collapse of gas clouds. What stops the collapse, eventually? Why doesn't the collapse continue down indefinitely, to a point?

- Protostars release gravitational potential energy as heat (remember the KH timescale)
- Main sequence stars and 'burning' stars, have nuclear reactions to release heat
- This heat creates pressure in the interior that stops further collapse (hydrostatic equilibrium - see @fig-balance-he, @fig-hydroeq-pressure).

Based on the ideal gas law
$$
P = nRT/V,
$$

we need a finite temperature $T$ to create pressure.
Since a star is losing heat into space, the heat energy must be continually replenished.

![Hydrostatic equilibrium condition in a star. The gravity is balanced by the internal pressure. The higher the temperature, the higher the thermal pressure (the atoms in the core will have higher kinetic energy).](img/hydroeq-pressure.gif){#fig-hydroeq-pressure}

- In protostars, contraction continues until fusion takes over
- In burning stars, fusion of successively heavier elements takes place
- But there is a limited amount of fuel in a star (see Iron Catastrophe in Chapter 6, @fig-iron-catastrophe).

When the fuel runs out, the star will resume _contracting_, since there is no longer a thermal pressure to balance gravity.

- So what is it that keeps White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars etc from collapsing?
- And why is it that some stars _do_ collapse to black holes?

## Low-mass stars ($\sim 1 M_\odot$)

Low-mass stars fuse elements up to carbon. Thereafter, because stellar mass is low, core pressure due to self-gravity is not enough to cause sufficient temperature rise to begin fusion of heavier elements.

Outer layers are expelled to form a planetary nebula and the carbon core collapses to form a __white dwarf__ (see Chapter 9).

## High-mass stars ($\gtrsim 8M_\odot$)

Stars continue fusion up to nickel and iron. Iron is the most tightly bound atomic nucleus -- no more energy available from fusion.
 
Star also collapses, but since it is much more massive than a white-dwarf-progenitor, more gravitational energy can be released: much more violent event -- a __supernova__.

## Fates of stars

| ZAMS mass | Collapsing mass | Fate |
|-----------|-----------------|------|
| $\lesssim 8\,M_\odot$ | $1.4\,M_\odot$ | White Dwarf |
| $8 - 25 M_\odot$ | $1.4 - 3 M_\odot$ | Neutron Star |
| $\gtrsim 25 M_\odot$ | $\gtrsim 3 M_\odot$ | Black Hole |


In very late stages of stellar evolution, much of the star's initial mass (_Zero Age Main Sequence Mass_) is blown off as the outer layers are shed into space (_radiation pressure_). The mass of the collapsing core is therefore much less than the _ZAMS_ mass.

Most of the mass blown off into the interstellar medium can then be recycled to form other stars.

# Supernova classification

Supernovae are classified into different types depending on whether they show hydrogen in their spectrum, as we already anticipated in Chapter 3, when we talked about binaries.

- __Type I__: have almost no hydrogen.
- __Type II__: do show presence of hydrogen.

Type I supernovae are further classified in different categories based on the presence of other chemical elements (see @fig-supernovae-categorization-tree).

![Schematic tree for the categorization of Supernovae.](img/sn_cat.png){#fig-supernovae-categorization-tree}

- __Type Ia__ are believed to be the result of accreting white dwarfs in a binary system (see Chapter 3), being pushed over the mass limit and undergoing further nuclear fusion in a runaway reaction that destroys the star.
  - Type Ia are found in all types of galaxies.

- __Types Ib, Ic and II__ result from the collapse of high-mass stars straight to a neutron star or black hole.
  - The lack of hydrogren in these categories indicates that the the stars involved have been stripped of their hydrogen envelopes.
  - Types Ib,c are only found in spiral galaxies where there was recent star formation.
  - This implies that Types Ib,c and due to massive short-lived stars.

Types Ia,b,c indicate that different mechanisms are at work.

# Supernova mechanism

Need $> 8M_\odot$ for core collapse to allow carbon and oxygen burning.

- An onion-like shell structure develops with fusion by-products (ashes), sinking down through the layers.
- The final stage is silicon burning, which generates a host of nuclei centred around the 56Fe minimum of the binding energy curve (@fig-iron-catastrophe) - iron-56 is one of the most tightly bound nuclei
- Since each stage is less energy efficient, they take shorter and shorter times to complete (for a 20$M_\odot$ star, Hydrogen burning took 107 years; Silicon burning takes âˆ¼days).

![Nuclear binding energy per nuclear particle, showing the iron at the bottom of the curve, so nor fission or fusion can happen after this is produced.](img/iron_catastrophe.png){#fig-iron-catastrophe}

- Nuclear fuel is exhausted in the core. Radiated energy can no longer be replaced, so pressure falls.
_Hydrostatic equilibrium is lost_, so core rapidly contracts ($\sim 1/4$ second).
    
- Contraction releases gravitational potential energy, causing temperature to rise to $T\sim~ 5\times 10^{9}$K. High temperature allows _endothermic_ (heat absorbing) reactions.

## Endothermic reactions

### Photodisintegration

Earlier _exothermic_ fusion reactions are reversed: photodisintegration.

High energy photons like gamma photons can be absorbed, causing the nucleus to change to another species, emitting a subatomic particle (i.e. alpha particle, proton or neutron).

$$
\begin{align}
  ^{56}_{26}\text{Fe}+\gamma&\rightarrow
  13\,^{4}_{2}\text{He}+4\,\text{n}\nonumber\\
  ^{4}_{2}\text{He}+\gamma&\rightarrow 2\text{p}^{+}+2\,\text{n}\nonumber
\end{align}
$${#eq-photodisintegration}

### Neutron capture

Neutron caputre are other endothermic reactions that take place when an atomic nucleus collides with one or more neutrons, and merging they form an heavier nucleus.

Elements _heavier_ than iron can be created by neutron capture,e.g.
$$
\begin{align}
  ^{56}_{26}\text{Fe}+128\text{n}&\rightarrow
  ^{238}_{26}\text{Fe}\nonumber\\
  ^{238}_{26}\text{Fe}&\rightarrow ^{238}_{92}\text{U}+66\text{e}^{-}+66\bar{\text{v}}_{\text{e}}\nonumber
\end{align}
$${#eq-neutron-capture}

Produces elements heavier than iron, e.g. copper, silver, gold, platinum, bismuth, thorium, uranium, etc.

### Electron capture

Endothermic reactions absorb $\sim 2/3$ of gravitational energy released by initial collapse $\rightarrow$ further contraction $\rightarrow$ further temperature rise.
  
Core temperature reaches $\sim 10^{10}$K. Hot enough for inverse beta decay (reverse of normal beta decay of radioactive nuclei).
$$
\begin{align}
  \text{p}^{+}+\text{e}^{-}&\rightarrow
  \text{n}+\text{v}_{\text{e}}\nonumber
\end{align}
$${#eq-electron-capture}

This process is highly endothermic. 
A proton and an electron ($\text{p}^{+}$ and $\text{e}^{-}$) become one neutron and emit a neutrino. 
Since neutrinos are very weakly interacting, they easily escape to space.

Consequence: extreme pressure drop in core.
The core separates from the outer envelope and goes into __free-fall__, collapsing at $\sim 10^{5}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1} (\sim 1/3 c).$

## Collapse

- Core collapses to radius of $\sim 20$ km. Consists of closely-packed neutrons at $\sim 3\times$ nuclear densities ($\sim 10^{9}$ tonnes cm$^{-3}$).
- At this point, core stiffens due to __degeneracy pressure__ (see Chapter 8) and abruptly halts collapse. Degenerate core rebounds slightly, sending shock wave back up through in-falling material.
- Shock wave initiates further endothermic reactions and loses energy, but is boosted by huge flux of neutrinos emanating from core.
Further in-falling material continues to strike degenerate core and rebound $\sim$ elastically.

## Remnant

Bouncing material and enormous neutrino flux blows outer layers of star off into space, forming a supernova remnant.

# An example: The Crab Nebula

![Crab Nebula.](img/crab.jpg){#fig-crab-nebula2}

<!-- <div style="right_panel"> -->
- The Crab Nebula is ${\sim}6500$ light years away.
- Diameter of $\sim 11$ light years.
- Current expansion velocity $\sim 1500$ km s$^{-1}$, i.e. $\sim 0.5\%$ of speed of light.
- This is the 2nd recorded observed supernova. Seen on July 4th 1054 by
a court astrologer during China's Sung dynasty.
- Initially visible during the day!

# Why do SN remnants expand so quickly?

![Representation of density blocks of material encountered by shock waves as they travel toward the outer part of the star.](img/density.svg)

As the shock wave travels out through stellar envelope, carrying energy and momentum, it encounters material of ever decreasing density.

![Blocks of smaller mass per unit area are encountered by shock waves as they propagate.](img/volume.svg)

Energy and momentum is conserved. __Shock wave__ passing into lower density region transmits momentum to a progressively lower mass of material per unit surface area of the wave.

From the definition of momentum $p=mv,$ we know that roughly the same $p$ and smaller $m$ results in larger $v$. Low-density outer layers attain huge expulsion velocity.

# Energy Budget and Luminosity

![Supernova SN1994D.](img/SN1994D.jpg){#fig-sn1994d}

Observationally, supernovae brighten rapidly to $\sim10^{9}\,L_{\odot}$ in about 10 days, then slowly dim over about 100 days, i.e. they may briefly outshine their entire host galaxy.

Energy source is the _release of gravitational potential energy_ by the contraction of the core.
  
![Core contraction from a core of radius $R_0$ to a neutron star of radius $R_{NS}$.](img/contraction.jpg){#fig-core-contraction}

Gravitational potential energy of a uniform sphere is roughly
$$
E_G=-\frac{GM^{2}}{r}.
$$
So the energy released by contraction, from the core initially having radius $r_1$ (when the contraction starts, assuming no more mass is lost) to the neutron star of radius $r_2$, is roughly
$$
\Delta E\approx\left(\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{1}}\right)-\left(\frac{GM^{2}}{r_{2}}\right).
$$
Since $r_{1}\gg r_{2}$
$$
\Delta E\approx \frac{GM^{2}}{r_{2}}
$${#eq-deltae-contraction}

- Using typical __neutron star__ values of $M=1.4M_{\odot}$ and $r_{2}=20$km, we find energy released $E\approx 10^{46}$ J.
- This is equivalent to $L_{\odot}$ emitted continuously for $10^{20}$ seconds, or $\sim 100$ times the Sun's total energy production over its Main Sequence lifetime, but in only $\sim 1/4$ second!

__Where does all this energy go?__

- About $2/3$ of released energy is reabsorbed in endothermic reactions.
- Most of remaining $1/3$ is released as neutrinos - about $10^{57}$ of them.
- About $1\%$ goes into kinetic energy of the _ejecta_.
- About $1\%$ goes into photons, with about $0.01\%$ as a visible flash.

- Supernovae produce __cosmic rays__ (extremely high energy particles, mostly protons but also some electrons and heavier nuclei).
- Supernovae distribute heavier elements into space, which are then incorporated into new stars and planets. Some of the material in the human body was "cooked" in supernovae.


## Supernovae and the interstellar medium

- The supernova shock wave can disrupt interstellar gas clouds, perturbing their equilibrium and causing collapse and fragmentation -- new stars form, thus completing the cycle of stellar life.
- With roughly 2 supernovae per galaxy per 100 years, and about $10^{11}$ galaxies in the universe, there are on average about 50 supernovae per second!
